"For vegetables, your best bet is to get some drip lines 'cause you don't want
to get water on the leaves" said the helpful employee at a local farm supply
store. I have heard this "advice" *numerous* times over the past few years, and
it gets a little deeper under my skin each time I hear it. Like most advice
handed out in this fashion, there's a kernel of truth hiding somewhere behind
layers of indirection associated with such old wive's tales.

As I mentioned in my [last gardening related
post](/2017/09/13/growing-tomatoes.html), I am certainly not an expert, but I'm
also not a novice. Therefore take what I'm about to tell you as nothing more
than a pile of supposition from lots of reading and years of experimentation.

The nugget of fact behind "don't get water on the leaves!" comes down to, at
it's most basic level, avoiding scenarios which might promote fungal or mildew
growth on plant leaves. That said, **leaves are meant to get wet**, in fact,
most leaves helpfully channel water to the root system of the plant. This past
season, I marveled at how perfectly the ridges in the okra leaves bowed and
dripped water directly into the root zone. However, if leaves _remain_ wet,
that can promote the growth of crop-destroying fungi and mildews.


The most common affliction most home-gardeners will likely recognize would be the
ever-spiteful **powdery mildew**. Powdery mildew can spread from leaf to leaf
and demolish an entire crop. At the end of the summer season, my friend's
pumpkin patch has been nearly entirely obliterated by powdery mildew. The
blight has destroyed leaves up and down the vines and even spread to some
pumpkins in the patch. Words cannot quite describe the nauseating sight of a
20lb pumpkin which been engulfed with the chalk-like green of the mildew.

I can state with confidence that my friend definitely was spraying water all
over the leaves of that pumpkin patch. I can also state with confidence that
simply spraying "water on the leaves" was _not_ the cause of his mildew
problem.

Some key contributing factors to fungal and mildew growth can be:

* **Splash-back**: spores can remain dormant in the soil for _years_, and using
  a high-pressure hose which splashes water and soil _up_ onto the plant, can
  be a big contributing factor to growth. In my experience, this usually takes
  the form of mud splashing back onto the bottom of leaves, giving the spores a
  nice hiding spot to germinate and start ruining things.
* **Tainted soil**: if a patch, or an adjacent patch, becomes contaminated with
  spores, the next season you simply cannot plant the same plants there.
  Plantings should be rotated anyways, but if an area with squash/gourds becomes
  contaminated with any fungus, I wouldn't plant squash/gourds anywhere near it
  for at least a few years.
* **Low-wind/stagnate air**: areas where the soil stays moist, with stagnate
  air, can also foster ideal growing conditions for mildews. Anecdotally
  speaking, I have _only_ ever seen mildew in garden plots which have
  little-to-no cross-wind. Plots whose air is especially stagnate during the hot
  summer months which have low-wind conditions. The stagnate air means the soil
  is going to dry-out slower and the air above the soil will remain more humid;
  a perfect environment for mildew.
* **Keeping leaves wet overnight**: as the air cools, it's ability to accept
  moisture lowers. In essence, it takes much longer for water to evaporate at
  night than during the day. Generally this is why many people will water their
  plants at night, but allowing leaves to remain wet for long periods of time can
  also be risky. In west Sonoma county, due to on-shore flow, it's typically
  more humid at night which can make evaporation that much slower. The longer
  the leaves remain wet, the more vulnerable they can be to fungal growth.
* **Specific plants**: as alluded to before, squashes/gourds (summer squash,
  zucchini, cucumber, pumpkin, and other gourds) can be particularly
  susceptible to powdery mildew. Tomatoes can also suffer from a number of
  leaf-curling blights. Depending on the conditions of your garden, some plants
  might not have what it takes to survive in a specific spot, or the location
  in general. This doesn't just come down to
  likelihood of blights, fungi, and mildews, but also pollinators, soil quality,
  wind, and sun.


Much of gardening is simply providing an environment in which the plant you're
growing will have it's best success. Unsurprisingly, most plants want to live.
Your job as a gardener is to ensure the most suitable conditions for the plant
to succeed, without enabling other naturally occurring organisms (fungus,
mildew, weeds, etc) an opportunity to themselves succeed.

It's not just as simple as "don't get water on the leaves!" Which, said alone,
is such simplistic advice you might as well treat it as a pleasantry like "have
a nice day!"

Smile, nod, and on your way out the door respond with a hearty "you too!"
