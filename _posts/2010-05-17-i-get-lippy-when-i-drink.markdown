Most folks that know me, either virtually or otherwise, know I have opinions. Plenty of opinions, regardless of whether or not I'm qualified to comment on the subject, chances are, I will. At <a id="aptureLink_l1nPo1jdAq" href="http://twitter.com/21stAmendment">21st Amendment</a> last Friday, I was in quite a "mood" and poking fun at a few people, of course Can dutifully posted them to twitter, all of which I feel need explaining.

Some how Chris Messina and David Recordon came up in the conversation, I'm not afraid to say that I've known of them both for almost three years now, and I still don't have a clue what they actually *do*.

Apparently Can doesn't know you can buy Bison meat (a tasty alternative to beef), Can also thinks 6 sushi rolls are enough for lunch, suffice to say he has the eating habits of a <a id="aptureLink_FaTjmnoIvu" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRLkcmkSUG4">Maury Povich baby</a>.

When discussing Apture's advisors, <a id="aptureLink_0lKAauLo8Y" href="http://twitter.com/dotben">Ben Metcalfe</a> came up, smart guy, fun to hang out with but apparently worked for the BBC in his teens, which I didn't know before Friday evening.

In the interest of full-disclosure, I was drinking. 

If you're interested in hearing me poke fun at myself, you, your startup, your colleagues or your investors, do join me at 21st Amendment next friday at 5 p.m.
