It's [that time again](http://fosdem.org)! FOSDEM 2015 is quickly approaching
and just like [last year](/2014/01/05/another-february-in-yurp.html) I'm
thrilled to be going again. This year I will be making a stop-over for a few
days in London (Jan 24-28th) to visit the [Lookout](http://lookout.com) London
office before heading towards Brussels. If you're interested in drinking a beer
in either location, ping me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/agentdero) or
email.


I did the math in my head yesterday and this year will be the **fifth** year
that I've attended FOSDEM: 2005, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. This will be my
fourth year helping organize a [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org) stand, my third year
organizing the [Testing and Automation
devroom](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/) and my
**first** year organizing a [Ruby
devroom](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/track/ruby/).


Between the schedules for the Testing/Automation and the Ruby devroom,
I am thrilled with the amount of great content that I've been able to help
bring to FOSDEM. But that just covers *two* rooms, between the main tracks
and 40 devrooms, words cannot describe the sheer volume of great content and
great people who will be present.

If you're not able to make it to FOSDEM,
[video.fosdem.org](http://video.fosdem.org/) has most of last year's talks and
will have archived recordings of the 2015 talks as well.


If you **can** make it to FOSDEM, come say hello!
