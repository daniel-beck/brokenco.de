I am watching this show on "the long war [on terror]" ("Our childrens' childrens' war") which is covering private contracting firms that are working with the military, specifically <a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com/">Blackwater USA</a> which is seriously one of the scariest companies I've read about in a while. I'm not a fan of our ever growing federal government, but turns out they're dutifully employing <em>mercenaries</em> in a war on an already questionable moral foundation? Fun.<br>
<br>
There is no question that we're involved in a global war of ideologies, but we're walking a fine line between that and a crusade, and mercenaries only sweeten the pot.
