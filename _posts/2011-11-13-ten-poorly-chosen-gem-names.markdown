title: 10 poorly chosen Ruby gem names

There's something weird in the Ruby community that has been driving me crazy
since I started using the language. There's this habit, by what I hope is a
minority, of choosing "clever" gem names instead of useful or descriptive
names. I'm not above a good pun or play on words, but some gem names range
between confusingly stupid and utterly aggrevating.




#### Probably offensive

I basically spent about 30 minutes typing borderline or completely NSFW terms
into the [rubygems.org](http://rubygems.org) search box to come up with this
list. It's a little longer than 10 gems, I didn't anticipate finding so many
"gems" (so to speak).

For slang or singular terms, I will include the definition according to Google, of the term to the right of
the gem.

* [lolita](https://github.com/ithouse/lolita) - *A sexually precocious young girl*
* [tranny](https://github.com/joshkrueger/tranny) *Short form of transmission in the automotive sense; ...  A transgender person.* (the second link listed was to tranny/shemale porn)
* [asset\_hat](http://github.com/mintdigital/asset_hat) (pun on "ass hat", clever)
* [sex\_it\_up](http://github.com/aantix/sex_it_up)
* [womanizer](http://rubygems.org/gems/womanizer) *a man who likes many women and has short sexual relationships with them.*
* [analogger](http://rubygems.org/gems/analogger)
* [trollop](https://rubygems.org/gems/trollop) *A woman perceived as sexually disreputable or promiscuous.*
* [hash\_dealer](http://github.com/LifebookerInc/hash_dealer)
* [ball\_gag](https://rubygems.org/gems/ball_gag) *A gag is sometimes worn during some bondage and BDSM roleplays.*
* [clitt](https://github.com/francois/clitt)
* [tramp](https://rubygems.org/gems/tramp) (debatable whether is closer "Lady and the Tramp" or "Tramp Stamp")
* [texticle](http://rubygems.org/gems/texticle) (*thanks for the reminder [@scottmlikens](https://twitter.com/scottmlikens)*)

*Tips for Naming a Gem:*

* Can you make an incredibly obtuse pun on the name of the library you're wrapping?
* Grab a photo album from your childhood, find a picture of your bedroom, what's the name of the first thing you see?
* Are you coding in between bong rips? Choose a word that sounds the funniest to your stoner friends.
* Are you British? What is the local slang term for "slut?"
* Go to 4chan, pick the 7th word of a random post to /b/
* Are you a white guy from Memphis who loves Asian culture? Use the Japanese name of the nearest household appliance.

#### Just plain stupid

While searching for blatantly offensive gem names, I found a number of other
"wonderfully" named gems that don't offend so much as they confuse. There was such a
plethora of simple nouns which can make searching for documentation
exceptionally difficult for novice users.

* [cocaine](https://rubygems.org/gems/cocaine)
* [girlfriend](https://github.com/icebreaker/girlfriend)  (okay, the name is appropriate, but seriously, what the?)
* [smurf](http://github.com/thumblemonks/smurf)
* [tit](https://github.com/adlaiff6/tit)
* [analdiffist](http://github.com/radamant/analdiffist) 
* [nokogiri](https://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri), from my understanding a Nokogiri is a [saw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_saw)?
* [miniskirt](http://github.com/stephencelis/miniskirt)
* [hoe](https://rubygems.org/gems/hoe)
* [vegas](https://rubygems.org/gems/vegas)
* [loofah](http://github.com/flavorjones/loofah)
* [mandy](http://github.com/trafficbroker/mandy)
* [home\_run](http://github.com/jeremyevans/home_run)
* [hansel](http://github.com/xlymian/hansel)
* [vacation](http://github.com/ohrite/vacation)
* [whoa](http://github.com/richmolj/whoa)

I don't have much of an idea what half of these gems do, and I can't be
troubled to dig into what the use case is for "cocaine", "vegas" or "whoa", at least from
the Ruby perspective that is.
