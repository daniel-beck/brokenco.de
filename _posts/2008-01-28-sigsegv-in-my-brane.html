I'm not proud of it, but I do read TechCrunch every now and again, if for only the occasional gem that comes across that causes me to hate buzzwords and everybody that uses them. <br>
<br>
In the second paragraph of <A href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/28/imeem-gobbles-up-a-young-startup-anywherefm/" target="_blank">this article</a> almost caused an entire system shutdown in my central-buzzword-processing unit (CBU):<br>
<br>
<center><em>"Both Imeem and Anywhere.FM saw a lot of synergy in the deal."</em></center><br>
<br>
I couldn't read any further into the article after reading that, whenever anybody uses the word "synergy" seriously I have a tendency to tune out completely and think the absolute worst of them until they offer me chocolates, caffeine or other goodies.
