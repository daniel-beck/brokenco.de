Steve Scott of <A href="http://latenightcocoa.com/">Late Night Cocoa</a> asked me a couple weeks ago if I wanted to come on and talk about <a href="http://bleepsoft.com/buildfactory">BuildFactory</a> and continuous integration, and then that slowly morphed into talking about webservices and Dumbarton as he noticed I posted some WebServicesCore gripes. We got to chatting a bit about why Mac developers don't seem to "appreciate" webservices as much as those in the .NET world, etc and eventually got together to record <a href="http://latenightcocoa.com/?q=node/20">Web Services with R. Tyler Ballance</a>.<br>
<br>
If you've not checked out Late Night Cocoa, I highly recommend it, it's already shaping up to be a good (technical) podcast about Mac development (the <A href="http://latenightcocoa.com/?q=node/16">Core Data with Marcus Zarra</a> interview was fantastic, a hard one to follow). If nothing else I hope most developers can use my interview to get a better feel for what's available in the growing webservices (2.0!) landscape. A more active discussion about the strengths and weaknesses in the Cocoa frameworks can do nothing but make the Mac development community stronger, check it out!
