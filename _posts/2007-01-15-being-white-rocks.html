On my recent trip back from <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/tyler/roadshow_departing">road trip</a>, I couldn't help but appreciate Chris Rock's commentary on "being white" when he said "I always viewed being white like always having five bucks in your pocket."<br>
<br>
Sitting in line at a border patrol station just east of El Paso, I watched a hispanic family in a van get inspected relatively thoroughly, and couldn't help but giggle at the "inspection" that awaited me:<br>
<strong>Are you a U.S. citizen?</strong><br>
<em>arrrrrrr</em><br>
<strong>...Is that a yes or a no?</strong><br>
<em>yes.</em> (-_-)<br>
<strong>Have a nice day.</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
I feel secure.<br>
