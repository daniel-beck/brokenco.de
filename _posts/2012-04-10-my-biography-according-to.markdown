For an upcoming internal tech-talk that I will be giving titled "Amber:
Smalltalk in your browser, or, Tyler is a hypocrite."

[Thomson](https://twitter.com/itsthomson), an esteemed colleague, tech talk organizer, and by far the hardest
working Filipino I know, sent out the following bio attached to the meeting
invite:

> A decorated veteran of two wars (the Korean War and the War on Drugs), R.
> Tyler Croy is an Infrastructure engineer at Lookout, bringing with him decades
> of obscure programming language experience. Previously at Apture (and before
> that, Slide), Croy has now avoided working for Google as the result of an
> acqui-hire twice (and counting). At Lookout, he is responsible for ensuring the
> fidelity of our server infrastructure, and as such possesses an extensive duct
> tape library under his desk. Croy is a graduate of the school of hard-knocks
> and speaks five languages (four of which exist solely on the internet). He is
> originally from Texas (which explains his casual, laconic southern drawl), and
> enjoys mint juleps, stealing road dots off of the highway, and yelling at folks
> to get off his lawn. He currently lives in Vallejo with his wife, two cats, and
> pet charizard.


He knows me so well.
