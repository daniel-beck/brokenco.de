I'm certain that this doesn't interest anybody in the slightest, but I just upgraded the entire site to Drupal 6.0.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately some modules like <a href="http://drupal.org/project/jstools" target="_blank">jstools</a>, or the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/adsense" target="_blank">Adsense module</a> haven't been ported over yet so I've just gone ahead and disabled them for now until everything gets back to normal in the land of <a href="http://drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal</a>.<br>
<br>
I've been very pleased with Drupal as a CMS, and am really look forward to them tightening up Drupal 6 further on in the release cycle, but right now everything is looking promising enough to jump ship from Drupal 5.xx.
