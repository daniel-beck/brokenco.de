Time-Warner (again) had an outage this morning, and it has somehow left my Linksys WRT54G absolutely incapable of routing properly.<br>
<br>
From the router administration page, I can ping public servers. From inside the network, I can ping ping local machines. I can properly resolve hostnames, I just can't ping anything on the public internet, from inside the network. My router has become absolutely dysfunctional as anything but a simple switch.<br>
<br>
I'm only lamenting that I don't know of a taller building from which to hurl this miserable piece of shit from.
