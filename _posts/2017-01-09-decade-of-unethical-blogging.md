Earlier this year, 2017, I passed a curious milestone. I have now been blogging
on this domain for over a decade. Many of those who know me might have the
impression that I'm a fairly honorable and trustworthy individual, making
"unethical blogger" a confusing banner to operate under. I suppose I should
shed some light on the origins.

The "Unethical Blogger" concept was originally a snarky response to some fervor
over the bloggers getting _paid_ to write blog posts. In this bygone era of the
web, the notion that bloggers were **JOURNALISTS** was still en vogue. This
notion was, of course, perpetuated by a number of semi-professional and
professional bloggers who fancied themselves the heirs to 21st century
journalism. The discussion among some "Web 2.0 bloggers" turned to "blogging
ethics" and that's when I tossed my hands in the air and proclaimed that I was
not an "ethical blogger," for whatever "ethical blogging" might entail.

I feel fortunate to have continued to write over the past ten years, not for
your sake but for _mine_. I can look back over a decade of my personal and
professional life and smile at what I have, and haven't, learned.

"Ethics" aside, I consider a blog to be the soap box from which you can lay
claim to your thoughts, ideas, and experiences in the cacophony of noise that
is the internet.
