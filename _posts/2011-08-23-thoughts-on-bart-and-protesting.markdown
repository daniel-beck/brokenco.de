After leaving work yesterday, I walked with the protestors who were parading up
and down Market St., while I'm ideologically in line with the protestors I
wasn't really doing much other than walking, and occasionally tidying up, as
captured by one of the other protestors in this image (that's me picking a
trashcan up out of the road).

I wanted to jot down my opinions in a cohesive post, rather than a jumble of
tweets or retweets [on twitter](https://twitter.com/agentdero).

 * I don't necessarily think BART Police *must* be disbanded, but I do believe
   that the majority of its officers should _not_ be carrying guns. The first
   thing that's typically taught in Gun Safety classes is that you do not pull out
   a gun [in self-defense] unless you're absolutely certain you need to and are
   going to use it. An extension of that, in my opinion, is that you should not be
   carrying a gun unless it's necessary and you're going to be using it. BART
   Police should have guns at their disposal, but there is no need for every
   officer that walks the beat to carry a firearm.
 * Disrupting cell phone service for public safety on the platforms is
   reasonable in my mind, subject to judicious oversight. Disrupting cell
   phone service in _anticipation_ or in order to _prevent_ a protest is absolute
   crap.
 * BART's decision to simply shut down stations for a protest is absurd, it
   makes it incredibly easy for *any* protest in the future to gain a massive
   amount of press. Tip off BART that you will be protesting on a platform, get
   them to shut down the station, regroup above ground. That said, I don't know
   what a good solution would be, hundreds of people on the platform *is* unsafe.
   But it is also something that happens *every single day* during rush hour on
   BART platforms in downtown San Francisco.

I fear that the BART Board of Directors, or the Chief of BART Police might feel
like they cannot make any "concessions" to the protestors at all, which would
be most unfortunate. Would the public/press view their actions positively if
they acknowledged mistakes and heavy-handedness by BART Police?

I hope those involved in BART operations are able to see the root of the cause
of this episode of civil unrest and do something proactive about it instead of
continually sending men and women in riot gear to meet a frustrated populace
on the streets of San Francisco.
