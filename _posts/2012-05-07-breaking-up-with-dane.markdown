For a *long* time I've been a staunch supporter and happy customer of
[Sonic.net](http://www.sonic.net), the scrappy Bay Area internet service
provider that has recently started kicking ass, laying fiber, and embarrassing
bigger ISPs.


As of this past Sunday, only half of that is true. After a few happy years of Sonic.net
DSL, I had to leave Sonic.net. I think they're taking the break-up _okay_.

#### Backstory

A couple years ago I moved to sunny Berkeley, California. The rent in San
Francisco was just [too damn
high](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-rent-is-too-damn-high-jimmy-mcmillan),
and I discovered that almost everything I loved about the Haight district was
to be found in Berkeley. The "internet situation" in Berkeley leaves much to be
desired though, unlike
[Sebastapol](http://corp.sonic.net/ceo/2012/03/02/sebastopol-fiber-update/) or
certain areas of [San
Francisco](http://corp.sonic.net/ceo/2011/12/15/sonic-net-plans-gigabit-fiber-network-in-san-francisco-release/),
my favorite ISP isn't really paying attention to Berkeley.

It's not just my favorite ISP either, neither AT&T nor Comcast seems to give a
damn about my cozy little [earthquake death
trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayward_Fault_Zone).


What's a guy to do?

I suffered for a couple years with sub-6Mbps speeds, but with my most recent
move, my distance from the nearest
[CO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subscriber_line#Typical_setup)
would have put me in the low-4Mbps range which is simply unbearable.


Sure, things like an IPSec VPN service, "unsupported" IPv6 tunneling, stellar customer support, an
[engaging and receptive CEO](https://twitter.com/dane), plans for building a
next-generation fiber-to-the-home network, and many others, they're great and
all. That still doesn't make up for the fact that my wife can't watch
streaming bootlegs of "Toddler's and Tiaras" while I [work on serious
business](/2012/02/08/puppet-xml-a-brand-new-synergy.html).

It's not me, it's you.


#### Something new

Interestingly enough Sonic.net CEO Dane Jasper gave me the idea to look into a
wireless broadband provider with his post: "[I hate
wireless](http://corp.sonic.net/ceo/2012/04/04/i-hate-wireless/)." After some
digging, I discovered [Unwired Ltd](http://www.unwiredltd.com/), and
Berkeley-based company offering wireless broadband, if you're lucky enough to
have line-of-sight.

Turns out, I'm lucky enough!

When I found out Unwired had (great) line of sight to the top of my new house
in Berkeley, I asked for "the most." I didn't care so much about the cost, I
cared about getting the most damn speed I could possible achieve with the
microwave link. "Most" ends up costing about $130/month, about $40 more than my
last Sonic.net bill was, with 14Mbps down/8Mbps up (burstable, I know the
caveat here).

I will continue to cheer Sonic.net on, with their plans to lay fiber
in select parts of the bay area. If they ever decide to drop fiber in Berkeley, which
would be *very* surprising, then I will gladly sign up. Until then, I will be
trying out this newfangled wireless broadband.


You broke my heart Sonic.
