It's almost that time of year again! Almost time for [Southern California Linux
Expo](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale10x) in Los Angeles!

Last year I participated and helped man the [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org)
booth with the great folks from the openSUSE community. This year there is a
distinct possibility that I will help man a
[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins-ci.org) booth!

If you've not been, I recommend showing up and taking advantage of the
opportunity to meet other local open source users, developers, packagers and
sysadmins, all collected together under one roof.

The conference is still in the "call-for-papers" state, after which the
session schedule will be posted.


If you're within a 1-2 hour plane ride of Los Angeles, then I expect to see you
there!
