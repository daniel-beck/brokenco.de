This has been a whirlwind year for startups across the bay area and my startup, <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/r_tyler_ballance/my_new_startup">TY-Combinator</a> really is no different. Barely a month into 2008, <a href="http://www.slide.com">Slide, Inc</a> <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/r_tyler_ballance/five_and_seven_zeroes_is_big">announced it had received funding</a>, the recent news about the bid from Microsoft to purchase Yahoo! for just above the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)">GDP of Croatia</a> and now great news for the TY-Combinator.<br>
<br>
I'm pleased to announce that the TY-Combinator has received an unsolicited bid from Microsoft that values TY-Combinator shares at over 400% under market value. Microsoft is willing to offer TY-Combinator a half-eaten sammich in exchange for 85% of TY-Combinator outstanding shares. This is an exciting time to work for TY-Combinator, with the prospective addition of the capital Microsoft is willing to offer we will be able to finance new projects to expand our global reach over 1000%, up from our reported reach in the 2007 fiscal year of 1.<br>
