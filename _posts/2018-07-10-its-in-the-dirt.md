Last season I wrote down some of what I've learned [about growing
tomatoes](/2017/09/13/growing-tomatoes.html) and made certain to highlight the
importance of soil health. Unfortunately this season's tomatoes aren't doing as
well as I would like, and I'm relatively certain I know the culprit, despite
not having the time to correct it: soil health.

Frequently when I'm gardening, thinking about gardening, or just letting my
mind wander, a memory will pop into my brain of the lecture I attended last
summer about the Johnson Su Bioreactor presented by Dr. David C Johnson at
[Healdsburg SHED](https://healdsburgshed.com/) (video below).  In the lecture
Dr. Johnson discussed his work on a new form of _no-turn_ composting which
promotes significant fungal growth in the soil compared to traditional turned
or rotated compost. 

The benefits are multiple, but of primary interest to me are:

* Increased performance by crops planted into compost with high fungal content.
* Significantly amounts of carbon captured and sequestered into the soil.

When my mind wanders into this space, I think about commercializing the
bioireactor design for "mass market" usage. A significant problem which comes
to my mind for "green" commercial composting operations is that they rely on
_trucking_ to ship heavy soil to their customers, such as myself. Trucking not
only reduces the benefits of carbon capture, but adds costs to the soil. For
large gardens or small-scale farms, a generally accepted rule of thumb is that
you want to keep as much "on the property" as possible. If you're "importing"
something, that means you're probably "exporting" some of your cash. In order
to keep costs manageable; trucking in compost, or fertilizer for
non-permaculture oriented operations, is another out-of-pocket cost affecting
the bottom line.

Basing something commercial off the Johnson Su Bioreactor design, to me at least, would mean that a
vertical system standing in a 5-6 sq/ft portion of the garden were able to
produce a [yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_yard), or more, of viable
compost every nine months, that would be more than sufficient for my garden's
annual composting needs. Alternatively that same output could be converted into
an extract to innoculate a significant amount of seeds or spray a large plot of
soil.

Letting my mind day-dream even further, I consider the soil health challenges
for large scale permaculture and organic farms. Imagining how this design could
be scaled up, whether vertically or horizontally, to increase yields and
capture more carbon, thereby benefiting consumers and the climate.

Rather than thinking about selling soil, I dream of ways to sell shippable
"on-premise" networked systems for manufacturing high quality soil. The
relation between what I envision and existing large-scale composting operations
is similar to to the relationship between residential/small-scale solar panel
installations and large-scale solar or wind power plants: bringing the output closer to the
consumer and thereby increasing the overall production of the aggregated
system.

There's a common question people working at technology companies in the Bay
Area like to ask each other, paraphrasing: what would you _actually_ want to do
if the company goes public/gets acquired/etc? For many, they might buy some big
things (house, boat, etc), some may travel the world, others would start a
restaurant or other passion project.

For me I think it's a safe bet that if I leave ever
the tech industry you'll find me playing in the dirt.
