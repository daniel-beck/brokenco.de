I figured I'd try something different for my birthday this year, an event which
I normally don't celebrate at all.

I'm inviting everybody I know to come hang out at [21st
Amendment](http://www.yelp.com/biz/21st-amendment-brewery-san-francisco) and
have some drinks together on November 18th.

I will likely be heading over to 21st Amendment around 5:30 or so, depending on
how soon I want to start enjoying [Belgian Beer
month](http://blogs.sfweekly.com/foodie/2011/10/enjoy_a_staycation_with_the_br.php).


You can [RSVP here](https://gist.github.com/1353511) with your favorite meme
image, or whatever.
