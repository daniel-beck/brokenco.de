Somewhere amongst the stress of this past week, I neglected to mention that this weekend, i.e. today, there will be a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=4184233826" targer="_blank">Facebook Developer Garage in Palo Alto</a> Co-hosted by <a href="http://www.slide.com" target="_blank">Slide</a>.<br>
<br>
I'll be speaking, giving the presentation <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/r_tyler_ballance/coping_with_success_scaling_on_the_facebook_platform" target="_blank">I previously mentioned not being able to give</a>, on scaling on the Facebook platform and some of the key things to consider when choosing between and FBML or an IFrame based application. <br>
<br>
Not only will I be there, but most of the Slide/Facebook crew will be there along with (at latest count) about 300 people from around Silicon Valley who are interested in developing, monetizing, and creating on top of the Facebook platform.<br>
<br>
Feel free to stop on by to watch me say "um" too many times in front of 300 of my peers, good times will be had by all.
