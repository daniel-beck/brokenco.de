1. Configuration languages are too complex; YAML is much simpler and easier to
   understand.
1. Declarative YAML configuration is brilliant.
1. Lots of our things look similar, we have too much copy and pasted YAML.
1. We've written a tool which uses templates and parameters to dynamically
   generate our YAML
1. The declarative YAML format now supports conditional, iteration, and inheritance
   syntax; it is now turing complete.
