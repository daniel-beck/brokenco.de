As I mentioned in my [previous
post](/2012/11/18/testing-automation-devroom-fosdem.html) I'll be going to
[FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org) this year. Unlike last year, I will be spending a
*lot* more time in Europe this time around.

I will be arriving in Frankfurt on the 29th of January and spending a few days
in K&ouml;ln (Cologne). Naturally I will be in Brussels for FOSDEM for a couple
days, but after that, I will be heading to
[Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) for a few weeks.

I've already spent a good amount of time in Germany, so I won't be on the
"tourist track", having seen most of the sights in Berlin already.

So I will be working from Berlin, and my weekends and evenings will be open to
as many meetups/hackathons as I can find. Even if you don't want to hang out
(it's okay, I understand), but know of some good events in Berlin that are
worth checking out, please send me an email (tyler@linux.com) and let me know!

*What the hell is Yurp?*

Having spent a large amount of my time in the southern US, "Yurp" is how *far*
too many southern people pronounce "Europe", including those in my own family.
That's why I'm going to Yurp.
