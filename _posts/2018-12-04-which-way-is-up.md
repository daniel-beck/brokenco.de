With a clean air and a good bit of weather out in the big blue room, I decided
to take advantage of the opportunity and continue some of my [AIDS/LifeCycle
training](http://www.tofighthiv.org/goto/rtyler) _outdoors_ for a change. If
you have never been to Sonoma county, you may not be familiar with some of its
absolutely fabulous hills, valleys, and vistas. This past weekend I joined the
numerous cyclists out there charging about on our beautiful county roads.

This marked the first real ride since getting more [properly fitted on my bike
for ALC](/2018/11/16/fitted-for-alc.html), and I had planned it to be a quick
jaunt from Santa Rosa west towards Sebastopol and back.  There are two trails
which head west out of downtown Santa Rosa, the [Joe Rodota
trail](https://www.sonomacounty.com/outdoor-activities/joe-rodota-trail) and
the Santa Rosa Creek trail. This past weekend I learned the difference between
the two. 

Riding westward into the countryside, I began questioning my memory: "I could
have sworn this trail ran parallel to Highway 12?" With vineyards surrounding
me, I couldn't much complain, and rode onward. That was until the asphalt
turned into gravel and rock, which my road bike made clear was not a suitable
direction to continue riding. Stopping to pull out my phone and consult a map, I was
bemused to learn that I was much closer to Graton than I was to Sebastopol. Not
entirely lost, but not entirely going in the right direction either.
Turns out the Santa Rosa Creek trail heads northwest out of the city, and the
Joe Rodota trail, which heads due west, had branched off 7 or 8 miles prior.

Luckily enough, I was _generally_ heading the right direction, west-ish, so I
reoriented myself, found asphalt, and kept rolling, following a couple of other
cyclists on their spiffy looking tandem road bike.

After climbing _much_ more elevation than I had originally planned, as the due
west path between Santa Rosa and Sebastopol is very flat, I rolled into
Sebastopol and finally ended up on the _other_ end of the Joe Rodota trail. Following
the correct trail, albeit in the opposite direction, returned me to Santa Rosa
where I made note of the fork where I should have originally turned right,
in case I want to go direct to Sebastopol in the future.

All said and done, it was a chilly, comfortable, and enjoyable 20 mile ride.
Roughly 1/6th of what I will need to be prepared to ride, for five days straight,
as part of [AIDS/LifeCycle](http://www.tofighthiv.org/goto/rtyler). With my
indoor training setup, and my increasing familiarity with riding the roads of
Sonoma county, I'm not too worried about making it the 545 miles between San
Francisco and Los Angeles next June.

So long as somebody is keeping me pointed in the right direction.
