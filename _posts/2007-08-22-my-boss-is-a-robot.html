Sometimes <a href="http://max.slide.com" target="_blank">Max</a> tells me things that I find hard to believe, but after I verify that he's not just telling tall tales, they inevitably turn out to be 100% correct, which is scary.<br>
<br>
Jokingly I mentioned that "Max is a robot" today, to which he promptly corrected me stating that "it's already known" that <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/top/is-max-levchin-a-cyborg-169812.php" target="_blank">Max Levchin is a cyborg</a>.<br>
<br>
Some of my favorite quotes from this obviously factual article are:<ul><li>"The man is ripped. What human engineer has <em>biceps</em>?"</li><li>"When he worked at PayPal doing security (alert: common robot job).."</li></ul><br>
<br>
The WD-40 he keeps in his left back pocket, and the obvious mechanical extension of his hand (which assumes the shape of a Blackberry) should have been dead give-aways, but I somehow glazed over this.
