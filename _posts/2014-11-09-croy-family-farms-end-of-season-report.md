Earlier on this year I wrote [this
post](/2014/07/20/croy-family-farms-midseason-report.html) as a "mid-season"
report on how the little backyard farm (named [Croy Family
Farms](https://twitter.com/croyfamilyfarms)) of mine has been doing. Since that
time, in July, I've been eagerly waiting to write this post and somewhat
"conclude" the 2014 growing season.

The past couple of summers we have had a moderately active backyard garden, but
this year I wratcheted up the seriousness by keeping a spreadsheet with harvest
yields from specific dates, taking [numerous
photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/sets/72157644378992989/) and
towards the end of the season, a "lab notebook" with dated observations and
book-keeping of notable events (plantings, fertilizing, etc). If you're
interested in the layout of the farm, please consult my poorly laid out
documentation from the [previous
post](/2014/07/20/croy-family-farms-midseason-report.html#layout).

The tomatoes, cucumbers and the corn had the most impressive yield to me
personally, the **523** Early Girl tomatoes were created by **two** plants. The
45lbs of cucumbers were created by **three** plants, one of which died halfway
through their harvest period. The 41 ears of corn were grown from 17 plants
that reached maturity and were properly pollinated. More details on all of
these below.

### Tomatoes

The amount of tomatoes produced, and not produced, from this season is mind
boggling to me. In the "Underproducer Hall of Shame" we have: 1 Bush Beefsteak
plant and *2* Cherokee Purple plants. Despite my optimism for both of these
varieties of tomato, they both produced around 11lbs of tomatoes.

While heirloom tomatoes are generally not as productive as varieties like Early
Girls, I had no idea that the two Cherokee Purple plants would be so immensely
underwhelming.

I do not expect to plant either variety again, the cost-per-tasty-tomato ratio
is way out of my error bars.

</center>

*Meanwhile*, over in the "Hall of Obscene Productivity", we have: 1 Sun Gold
plant, and 2 Early Girl plants.

Many of my coworkers at [Lookout](https://www.lookout.com) grew to appreciate
my [weekly](https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/15128729972/)
[basketfuls](https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/14846459420/) of
[tomatoes](https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/15370576729/), that were
largely from these two varieties of tomato plants. I still find it nuts that
**a thousand** little Sun Gold tomatoes came from one plant, and that
**85lbs** of Early Girls came from the two other plants. I'm a slender man and
those two plants produced about half my weight in tomatoes over a single growing season (harvesting from early August to late October).

Last season I had a more crowded tomato patch, with eight plants, so the
decrease to six plants in the box I believe led to the more productive season.

Similar to last season however, all of these plants were purchased at a local
nursery, ain't nobody got time to grow tomatoes from seed.


<a name="cucumbers"></a>
### Cucumbers

For the 2013 season I had planted cucumbers in Box #2 without much structure or
anything around them. I had a couple lines of 4-5 plants going across the
narrow part of the rectangle, and the resulting crawling cucumber chaos meant
the plants were so intertwined that I would sometimes miss ripe cucumbers until
past their prime.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/14836701996" title="Today&#x27;s mega harvest at Croy Family Farms by R. Tyler Croy, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3890/14836701996_3c95d28ec9_n.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="Today&#x27;s mega harvest at Croy Family Farms" align="right"></a>

For this season I attempted more science, I planted [two plants inside of
tomato cages](https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/14057842758) and one
without. Over the course of the summer I would guide the growing vines of
the cucumber plants up and around the different levels of the cages. In the
case of one plant, it shot out a crawling vine to the side which I ended up
stabilizing with two garden stakes to make sure it didn't hurt the plant.

For some unknown reason the third plant, outside of a cage, died halfway
through the harvest period. While I don't want to draw a direct conclusion from
this one event, the leaves and plants in the cages appeared much more green and
healthy than last year's. I believe the separation of the leaves and the plants
themselves helped stem the spread of mildew and other pests that attack the
plents.

I did also identify a number of [cucumber
beetles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber_beetle) this season, but I
neglected to rid the garden of them.

<a name="corn"></a>
### Corn

[Last time around](/2014/07/20/croy-family-farms-midseason-report.html) I
remarked at how much fun growing corn was. When I had written the mid-season
report, I had only begun harvesting from the first corn crop. By the end of
July that crop had been fully harvested and removed, so I planted *another*
crop of corn. Both times the crops were grown entirely from seed.

For the second crop of corn I did a few things:

 1. I planted dried seeds from the first crop, my own seed!
 1. I planted a larger number of seeds.
 1. I worked almost an entire cubic foot of cow manure into the soil
 1. Wrapped the box in a [home made
    greenhouse](https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/14827989308/in/set-72157644378992989).

To the uninituated, corn does not self-pollinate, and therefore it much be
planted in rows to allow the wind to blow pollen from the male part of one
plant onto the female part of another plant. The fact that corn gets pollinated
at all might seem amazing until you shake a flowering corn stalk and see the
plume of pollen that they generate.

When I planned the second crop, I figured if I had a more dense "field" of
corn, then I would see a higher yield since there would be more pollen to go
around.

width="500" height="375" alt="The second @croyfamilyfarms corn crop is

**WRONG**.

The first crop had 7 matured plants that produced 24 ears of corn,
approximately **3.5 ears per stalk**. With the second crop, there were 10
matured plants, with 18 immature plants taking up space, and only 17 ears produced: **1.7 ears per stalk**.


I have a couple of potential explanations for this, but without further
experimentation I would not be able to be certain which had the greater effect:

 * The "field" laid fallow for only about a week before I worked lots of manure
   in and planted again. Corn is notoriously hard on the soil, so I may have
   just depleted too many nutrients from the soil.
 *  The corn plants were simply too numerous and too close together. The strong
    competetion for soil and sunlight may have caused the plants to devote too
    much energy to survival and not enough to making me tasty corn to eat.
    Considering this corn crop was almost a half foot taller, reaching 7 feet,
    than the previous crop gives this theory some weight.

With the next crop of corn I plant, I will be certain to rectify both potential
causes.

## General Notes

Below is a collection of notes and observations from my lab notebook:

 * Creating a [home made
   greenhouse](https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/14827989308/in/set-72157644378992989)
   for the corn sprouts *appears* to have accelerated their growth by keeping the
   soil warm and moist.
 * Pill Bugs (also known as rolly pollies) *will* eat baby leafy greens, such
   as kale or spinach started from seed.
 * Planting little red radishes in between the rows of the corn stalks did not
   work. THe resulting radishes were all very small. Apparently due to overly
   compacted dirt or competition with corn roots for space.
 * Lacinto kale requires far more sun than box #4 has available to it in order
   to grow effectively.
 * Planting snap peas (or beans) adjacent to corn, a la the [three sisters
   method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sisters\_(agriculture)) requires
   planting the snap pea seeds immediately after corn sprouts appear. By waiting
   until the corn shoots are at least 6" tall allowed them to overshadow and
   impact the growth of the snap peas.
 * Plants that aren't producing or contributing might as well be cut down to
   the soil level. Letting the plant die without disrupting potentially
   intertwined root systems. In the case of the dead cucumber plant, I believe
   this also prevented adjacent plants from being affected by mildewing leaves.
 * Spraying a soapy water mixture on an ant-aphid colony that had set up shop
   on one corn blossom **worked** and took care of the aphid problem in the
   corn for the rest of the season.
 * Black garden matting appears to work better as a soil insulator and
   protector than redwood mulch. The latter absords much more moisture than the
   former which allows some water to pool on the surface before being absorbed
   through the mesh.
 * Some combination of the low-sunlight and proximity to other bushes appears
   to cause a large number of caterpillars to munch on whatever is growing in
   box #4.
 * Squirrels *are* a pest that will steal and eat avocados and apricots. We did
   not witness them stealing tomatoes fortunately. A simple Daisy BB gun
   hanging by the back door has been sufficient to ward them off. Whenever they
   hear the BBs rolling in the barrel they flee into the trees.

## Final Thoughts

This growing season started late for me, I don't believe I put anything into
the ground until late April. Fortunately the bay area has a growing season of
almost 9-10 months, or even year round if you can protect your crops from the
frosts which hit in late November. Despite only six or seven months of growing
and harvesting, the entire endeavour was highly rewarding, even the parts where
a crop didn't work out (looking at you broccoli).

This year also had a fun social aspect to it as well. Last season I would bring
in tomatoes and basil for a few folks in the office, but with **more** this
year, I started sharing with the entire company. What better thing to share
with the people in your life than fresh, healthy *food*?  As a result of
sharing my regular bounties, I know the other gardeners in the office much
better, some of which who also started bringing in their bounties. I think I've
also helped show some how accessible gardening can be. Whenever conversations
would turn to "wow, you must be a good gardener, what do you do?" I would
always reply frankly "well, I put plants in the ground and then I water them
regularly, that's about it."

Truth be told, that's the majority of the work involved in gardening. It's a
great hobby for patience and diligence. Plants **will** grow, sometimes the
wrong ones (weeds) and sometimes not, but the important thing is to constantly
tend to the plot and make sure that your plants have every opportunity to
succeed.


While I didn't make any money from the farming this year, I can definitely see
myself visiting a farmer market with a crop somewhere in the next few years.
Of course, not from this little backyard garden but from a bigger parcel of
land that may be in our future. I wouldn't consider myself a genuine farmer by
any means, there's a lot more I have to learn, but owning more land means that
there is more space and opportunity to experiment with growing different crops
in different configurations.

I cannot recommend gardening highly enough.
