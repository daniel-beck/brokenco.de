DRM made news thanks to Steve Jobs' <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/">open letter</a>.  I don't really have anything to say that hasn't been said already, but I found an article today that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/02/16/drm-the-state-of-disrepair/">sums it up pretty nicely</a>.<br>
<br>
Of course I don't use iTunes much anyway, I'd much rather buy-and-rip CDs.  I guess I'm doing just what Bill Gates <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/14/bill-gates-on-the-future-of-drm/">says</a>.
