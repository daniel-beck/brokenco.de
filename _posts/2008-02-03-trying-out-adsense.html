In a vain effort to try to monetize all of the incredibly witty things that I do and say on this ridiculous excuse for a blog, I've started experimenting with <a href="http://google.com/adsense">Google AdSense</a> mixed in with some of the content on the site. They don't insert themselves into the RSS feeds (as far as I know) and they only show up for anonymous users to the site so I'm willing to bet that the majority of where my traffic actually goes won't be affected.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, since <a href="http://slide.com">Slide</a> has infected me with this weird disease where I obsessively watch numbers, I'll most likely be obsessively watching a large number of zeroes in the coming weeks. That said, you could <em>totally</em> screw with me by clicking around on a lot of the advertisements...seriously, that would totally irritate me...you should try it.
