<a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/450">Scott Stevenson</a> beat me to the punch in announcing it, but I might as well reflect the sentiment and invite you all (even those of you who actually don't live in Silicon Valley) to come out to Cupertino tomorrow (thursday) night to see if I can actually pull off a Windows-esque presentation in front of a room full of Mac developers.<br>
<br>
I will be discussing a lot of the latest developments in .NET 3.0 and Visual Studio 2005 and contrasting them where appropriate to the state of Mac development with Xcode, Cocoa, Objective-C and all the other niceties that Leopard's developer tools offer. If possible I will also try to work in a bit about <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono</a> as another alternative in the sea of options for developers these days.<br>
<br>
I'll make sure that I either post my slides to my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/agentdero">flickr stream</a> or the PDF of the slides to this blog after the fact. If I don't however post before Saturday that means I've probably been beaten up and left for dead by a room full of <em>angry</em> Mac developers.
