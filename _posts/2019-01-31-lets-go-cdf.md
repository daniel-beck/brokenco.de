Not knowing what I was getting myself into, about eleven years ago I started
contributing to what became known as the Jenkins project. What followed has
been nothing short of incredible; hundreds of new contributors, tens of
thousands of new users, and millions of executed pipelines. Growth is
challenging. Growth means new problems which demand new solutions.  Two and a
half years ago I stood in front of a large group of contributors at the 2017
Jenkins World Contributor Summit and made a pitch for what I called a "Jenkins
Software Foundation", never shy to pilfer ideas from the
[Python](https://python.org) community. With help from my pal [Chris
Aniszczyk](https://twitter.com/cra) and the Linux Foundation, the concept
morphed into something far more comprehensive the **Continuous Delivery
Foundation** (CDF), for which my colleague [Tracy
Miranda](https://github.com/tracymiranda) has been leading the charge, helping
drive the founding of the CDF.


[Kohsuke](https://github.com/kohsuke) wrote up a good [overview post for the
jenkinsci-dev@ mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/jenkinsci-dev/CAN4CQ4z%2BQzaBc1pDtciKXH%3DMhB3vUR%3DCShiFbwy__2W6eEH_EQ%40mail.gmail.com)
which spells out the reasons why the Jenkins project should join the Continuous
Delivery Foundation once it has been established. For those interested in the
Jenkins project, I encourage you to take the time to read Kohsuke's mail if you
have not already. In _this_ post, I wanted to share some of the reasons that _I_
am excited to help establish the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).


Continuous Delivery (CD) has been an integral part of my career, something which I
learned early and became passionate about, even before it was so clearly
characterized by Jez Humble. I view it to be so fundamental to the practice of
software development, that I have started to react like a puzzled puppy when
somebody says they don't practice CI or CD. Imagine if somebody said "eh,
we've got a project to adopt Source Control here, but the executives aren't
really convinced yet." Your eye would twitch and your jaw would drop. "How can
any organization not use Source Control in this day and age?!" I believe CD is
_that_ fundamental to modern software development.

Continuous Delivery is also **not** the domain a single tool like Jenkins, but
rather relies on many tools working together in concert.  While I might put
Jenkins at the center of it all, it is by no means the only pretty face in the
picture. Unfortunately, many open source communities like Jenkins tend to have
a necessarily narrower view of their world. They focus on _their_ thing, which
makes sense, but this can result in missed opportunities for incredibly
valuable cross-over episodes.

Many of the tools we rely on for CD are supported wholly, or in part by
different vendors as well. Jenkins receives substantial investment from
CloudBees, as well as Microsoft and Red Hat to name a few. In the last five
years, I have come to understand how and why foundations such as the CDF, can
act as neutral territory for these different companies. By providing corporate
contributors a set of guidelines, rules, and expectations, open source
projects stand a much greater chance of eliciting support from them. Whether
it's advocacy, code, or cash, helping bring corporate contributors under the
same neutral tent as the rest of us helps ensure the longevity of open source
efforts. The added benefit of the rules set forth by the foundation is that
corporate actors cannot overrun one another or individual contributors,
intentionally or otherwise.

In the earlier days of free and open source projects, we deluded ourselves into
thinking that everybody would read our licenses, subscribe to our "open source
ethos", file and fix issues, and contribute code back upstream. The reality is
that it takes a lot more to _operate_ large open source communities. It takes
_people_, it takes _infrastructure_, and it takes _money_. Foundations like the
CDF provide a means for organizations which depend on, or are otherwise
invested in projects, to participate in a meaningful way. The Jenkins
project runs on a shoe-string budget. We spend no more than $10-15k annually.
If we were to tabulate the value of our donated assets, free services, or any
of the other things I have managed to beg for over the past eleven years, that
number would be closer to 60-80k annually. Kohsuke can attest to my ability to
beg for free stuff for the Jenkins project, but free stuff is not guaranteed
year to year. In order to grow, Jenkins needs a stable budget which we can
invest in services and **people,** similar to larger foundations like the
[FreeBSD Foundation](https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/what-we-do/grants/). 

If you find yourself worried about the sustainability of open source,
looking at different community homes, crowd-funding, or other ideological tools such
as licensing changes, let me help you out. What makes large open source projects
sustainable is a consistent budget. Because underneath it all, what makes open source projects "go"
is _people_. Ensuring talented writers, developers, marketers, testers, and
designers continue to contribute means that their employers have to invest time
on their behalf, or they need to be paid through other means. I strongly
believe that open source foundations provide a path for larger free and open
source projects to solve that fundamental problem of _budget_.


The Continuous Delivery Foundation is not yet launched, but I'm already excited
for its potential. Not only for the Jenkins project, but for the entire domain
of continuous delivery.

It's about time.
