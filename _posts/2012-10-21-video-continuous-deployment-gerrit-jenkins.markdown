I promise this is the last video I'll post for a while. This talk was given at
[Jenkins User Conference
2012](http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb)
in San Francisco at the end of September.


This talk can be considered part of the same overarching narrative behind my
[Integrating Selenium after the
fact](/2012/10/08/selenium-meetup-video.html) presentation. Both talks are
addressing the same continuous deployment/delivery project at Lookout.


I apologize for some of the clipping of the slides in the presentation, use
your imagination to fill in the space to the left of the screen.
