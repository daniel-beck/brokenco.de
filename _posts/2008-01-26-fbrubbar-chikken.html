<a href="http://www.slide.com" target="_blank">We've</a> been working pretty hard for the past month (well, for the past 8 months too) but I'm particularly proud of the work that my <a href="http://uillinois.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1905532" target="_blank">co-conspirator</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=627205543" target="_blank">I</a> have been putting in on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2425101550" target="_blank">Top Friends</a> (we're that green line that creeps up from behind on FunWall and Super Wall).<br>
<br>
One of the most helpful "tools" that's been available to me has been Slide's competitive spirit. In addition to the 2,000+ developers on the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook platform</a> we have some pretty healthy competition going on inside Slide as well. Between Top Friends, SuperPoke and FunWall there is plenty of trash-talking and "friendly competition" (read: if it weren't an HR violation, I'd of already resolved to dirty tactics). In doing so we've cultivated an environment where some of the most often heard phrases are: "Is Facebook down again?!" and "OH SCHNAP!"<br>
<br>
Another key factor to our team's enjoyable demeanor has been (in my opinion) our liberal use of the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_chicken" target="_blank">rubber chicken</a>" as part of a sort of group hazing. In essence, when you have glaring mistakes that somehow get pushed to the live site, you will come into the office the next day with rubber chickens adorning your monitor. This group acknowledgement of when we "fuck up" encourages more of a social-pressure to write good code instead of relying on policy, etc to ensure code quality, especially on the rapid release schedules we adhere to. Rubber chickens are the truly quintessential gift at Slide, it is always feels better to give than to receive.<br>
<br>
As we near the end of the first month in 2008, I wish Facebook and Bebo continued success with there platform(s); not because I love FQL and FBML <em>oh so much</em>, but because I work for Slide, on the Facebook team, where competition and rubber chickens reign supreme in the land of embedded videos, sortable friends and flying sheep.<br>

(Now seriously, <a href="http://www.slide.com/static/jobs" target="_blank">Slide is hiring</a>)
