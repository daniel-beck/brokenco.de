Some time ago, whenever I started the draft for this blog post, I was
discussing with my colleague Kathy why I feel it's important for people to
write out their thoughts in long-form, ideally sharing them via a blog such as
this. My reasoning is not to build "your brand", share information, or anything
else like that per se. I find that fundamentally, taking the time to write my
thoughts down long-form helps draw more reasoned and nuanced thoughts out, and
allows the cultivation of a richer inner mental landscape.

While I obviously enjoy the [short-form dumpster
fire](https://twitter.com/agentdero), the platform itself doesn't lend itself to
thoughtful reasoned arguments, and I find that the medium used for
communication does _seem_ to have an effect on our own way of internalizing
information. Additionally, I think an overwhelming stream of information has a
tendency to forcefully insert thoughts and opinions into the reader's mind,
leaving precious little space left to the owner for forming their own unique
thoughts.

Contrasting that to the act of writing, spending the time to author a long-form
piece of content, which requires a more thoughtful processing and conveying of
information. Long-form also is done at your own speed, allowing plenty of time
for "hmmms" and "mmhmms". Working at my own pace allows me to compare points
and counter-points for my thoughts, and develop a reasoning of my own, without
somebody else explicitly inserting their own narrative into my mouth.

That time and space spent writing is something I believe everybody should
experience and practice. 

In short, writing enables me to **focus** on my own thoughts.

Writing itself doesn't necessarily require an audience or public posts, but I
argue that blogging publicly carries benefits atop just writing for one's self.
Blogging can still be very personal and at your own speed, since nobody knows
when you start a draft. And of course, nobody knows if you never finish a
draft. But completing and sharing that post with peers can help foster a
creative dialogue, opening new avenues of thought and discussion, and
_hopefully_ challenging or changing some of your ideas.

Outside of the personal benefits of blogging, I also think there is something
to be said about blogging for posterity; sharing your thoughts with the big
wide-open commons of the internet carries certain benefits unto itself.
Depending on the platform, your blog may even outlive you, serving as a
long-term stake in the ground for your thoughts and ideas, even if you're no
longer around to defend them.

Blogging isn't difficult, but most people I've discussed this with believe that
there is some mental barrier to entry, or that they "just don't have anything
important to say." I tend to disagree, but here are some suggestions of things
that I find interesting and worth sharing:

* Something you learned, no matter how small or obvious it seemed in
  retrospect.
* Thoughts on a current discussion happening in a project, organization, town, country, etc
* A recent accomplishment, and sharing how you arrived at that point.
* A recent failure, and a personal retrospective on what went wrong.
* Or of course, anything else you feel like writing, it's your blog after all!


Generally, I don't care what you write, how you write it, when you write it, or
where you post it. But I firmly believe that there's more than enough space on
the internet, and your thoughts are worth sharing!
