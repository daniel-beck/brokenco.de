This past September I was selected as a speaker at [PuppetConf
2014](http://2014.puppetconf.com) and given the oppoortunity to talk about some
of the patterns that we've developed to help run the Jenkins project
infrastructure.

Overall the conference was pretty spectacular, a great opportunity not only to
meet many of the folks I know on IRC but also a chance to meet up with people
who are using my software and figure out what we could do better together.

My talk, embedded below, is much more of a case study than anything else. Prior
to 2014 the Jenkins project infrastructure was doing *okay* but it wasn't
something I enjoyed working on. After a helping hand from Puppet Labs, we came
up with a workflow that I find much more enjoyable and resilient than our
previous workflow.
