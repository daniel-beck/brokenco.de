I'm not going to try to explain too much here, but I received my Neo 1973, the OpenMoko-based Smart phone today. While it's a developer preview, it's <strong>incredibly</strong> exciting. So far I've been able to use my Cingular SIM card, if you use AT&T/Cingular, you can check if yours is supported on <a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Carriers/ATT" target="_blank">the wiki</a>. I can run the general built in suite of applications without too much trouble, I also made a phone call, which <em>worked!</em> Unfortunately however the latest build that I have on my Neo doesn't have sound properly working, which <code>sagacis</code> from the #openmoko channel on Freenode is helping me with currently. I'm a bit over-excited so I'll let the images do the rest of the talking for me.<br>

In general, it's a bit slow, but the developer preview is probably about half as powerful as the planned public-released version. so I'm not exceedingly worried about that. This phone is just all around cool, and will hopefully be a fun device to carry around with me.
