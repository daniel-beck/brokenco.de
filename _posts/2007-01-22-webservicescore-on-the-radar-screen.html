A little birdie chirped into my email wondering what the radar number for my previous <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/tyler/webservicescore_why_hath_thou_forsaken_me">gripings about WebServicesCore</a>, and I figured that for all one of the Apple employees that actually read my inane bullshit, behold: <br>
<br>
Radar <a href="rdar://problem/4945073">#4945073</a> ("WebServicesCore lacks support for basic HTTP authentication")<br>
<br>
Let's all cross our fingers and hope for a much needed update to WebServicesCore. If all else fails, we can tap our <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/files/apple_shoes.jpg" rel="lightbox">shoes</a> together and wish for a new web services API right?<br>
