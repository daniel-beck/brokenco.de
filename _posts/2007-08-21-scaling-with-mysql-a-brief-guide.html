I've been thinking and experimenting a lot with MySQL 5, and PostgreSQL 8.3, trying to figure out which database server would be most optimal for scaling larger web applications.<br>
<br>
I've brought some of my MySQL optimization tips into a small e-book styled guide, something I hope will help my fellow developers understand what they are getting into before choosing a production environment with MySQL 4, or MySQL 5 in contrast to PostgreSQL.<br>
<br>
If you have any other tips for scaling with MySQL, I'll make sure I add them to my little e-book and release and updated PDF file :)<br>
