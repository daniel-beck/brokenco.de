Since the Jenkins update center is taking a little bit longer to propogate the
release of the [Vagrant plugin for
Jenkins](/2012/03/13/introducing-the-vagrant-plugin.html), I figured I'd create
a little demonstration for you.

The demo is from a running development environment I have locally, but once the
v0.1.2 version of the plugin is available in the update center, all of this
will work for you as well.
