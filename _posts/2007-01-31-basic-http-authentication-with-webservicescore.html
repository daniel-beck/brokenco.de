<a href="http://www.ditchnet.org">Todd Ditchendorf</a> is the man I have to thank now, not only for his fantastic <a href="http://www.ditchnet.org/soapclient/">SOAP Client</a>, but now for "showing me the way" in terms of using CFNetwork to handle basic HTTP authentication with SOAP webservices in Cocoa. Performing the basic HTTP authentication is still an absolute pain in the ass, but it is possible nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Without further ado, <a href="http://www.ditchnet.org/wp/2007/01/30/example-code-webservices-core-cfnetwork-for-soap-http-auth-on-os-x/">take it away Todd</a>.
