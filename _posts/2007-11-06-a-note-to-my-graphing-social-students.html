I figured I'd inform anybody that attended my <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/r_tyler_ballance/facebook_app_development_101_wrap_up">Facebook App Development 101</a> workshop at Graphing Social, that I have finally deleted the workshop test accounts that were located at workshop.monkeypox.org.<br>
<br>
I have made a backup of the database that we used to play around with the "Why are you awesome?" source code, and I have also backed up the files, so in case you forgot to get your modified files drop me a line and I'll fish your data out.<br>
