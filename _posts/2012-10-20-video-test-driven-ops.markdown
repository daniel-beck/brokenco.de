One more presentation video from [PuppetConf](http://puppetconf.com) a couple
weeks ago.

To be honest, I'm not terribly pleased with this presentation. It's the first
presentation in a long time where I felt like I was overly-nervous to the point
where it was affecting my ability to present. Watching the video after the fact
though, seems like the presentation went alright.

(I also did a crap job explaining what
[BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development). Shit happens
I suppose).

I still feel strongly about the subject, and look forward to revising this talk
more in the future to cover "more advanced" topics.
