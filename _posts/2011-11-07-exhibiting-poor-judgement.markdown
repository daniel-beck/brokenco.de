A [couple of months ago](/2011/08/21/run-tyler-run.html) my wife and I did a
10k trail run because, frankly, we're idiots. Continuing in that tradition, we
have a 12k trail run coming up this weekend, again, because we're idiots.

The 10k race back in September left me with a painful case of [runner's
knee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runner%27s_knee) in
my right knee which I'm still working through with the help of some
**drastically** better running shoes and a patella strap. Things are "trending
upwards" in that area, so I'm not too concerned there.


I've been a bit more confident in my preparedness for this trail compared to
last time around, or at least I thought I was until EC (wife) sent me this

While we're not doing the full 25k, we are doing up until about mile 7-8, which
still looks *brutal*.


Shit.
