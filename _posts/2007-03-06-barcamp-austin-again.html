It seems that I might be going to <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampAustin">BarCamp Austin<sup>2</sup></a> this next weekend. I'll be presenting on "the importance of webservices" or something about as exciting. I'm still working on my presentation (ick) and I'm going to try to incorporate as many useless buzzwords, pot-shots at George W. Bush, and cult movie references as possible. I'm not sure how it's going to be, at least 41% more exciting than my last BarCamp presentation on Cocoa hacking and why everybody should, but still 12% less turtle-neck than a Steve Jobs keynote. I'll be sure to post my slides and hopefully a video or audio of the presentation later, but we'll see if I can make a presentation worth posting first.
