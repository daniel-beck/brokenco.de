Okay, maybe not. But as it turns out, the <a href="http://www.unethicalblogger.com/posts/tyler/twitterbot_no_really_i_need_to_be_stopped">Twitterbot</a> however, is! A short 5-minute guide to setting up the Twitterbot has been created over <a href="http://engtech.wordpress.com/2007/03/22/howto-twitter-rss-broadcast-feeds-twitterbot-guide/">here on the engtech blog</a>, and does a far better job of documenting how to get started with the Twitterbot than I ever wanted to. With the help of a Twitterbot, <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> can be a great news-to-SMS gateway, or damn near anything else you can think of doing with about 140 characters worth of content either IMed or SMSed to you.
