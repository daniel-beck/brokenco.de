Rod reminded me with <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/2009/01/im_using_git_because_it_makes_me_feel_cool#comment-715" target="_blank">his comment</a> in one of <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/2009/01/im_using_git_because_it_makes_me_feel_cool" target="_blank">my other posts</a> that I've not yet mentioned <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">github</a>.<br>
