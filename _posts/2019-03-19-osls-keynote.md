Last week we announced the [Continuous Delivery
Foundation](https://cd.foundation) (CDF) at the 2019 Open Source Leadership
Summit. Through a strange series of events I was fortunate to attend and
participate in the "Continuous Delivery" keynote on the first day. Joining me
on stage was Kohsuke (Jenkins), Kim and Christie (Tekton), Tracy (Jenkins X), and Andy (Spinnaker)
to share a bit about the four initial projects joining the CDF.


Below is the full video from the keynote:

The entire launch of the CDF was quite an experience, but with the press
briefings now finished, the hard work begins. We are migrating assets over,
finalizing legal paperwork, and doing all of the needful behind the scenes
things that go into structuring an organization like the Continuous Delivery
Foundation.


Plenty of hard work ahead, but I'm happy to take a moment and consider all of
the work that we have done as a group to get to this point.
