Somehow I have been blogging [for over **eleven years**
now](/2007/01/03/new-blogthing.html). When I first registered
`unethicalblogger.com` it more or less a joke in response to a deluge of
holier-than-thou rhetoric about the "ethics of blogging", as if it were anything
more than soap-boxing on the internet.

I've decided to switch the domain over to another very-serious domain I had
purchased at one point, which has been mostly disused, _until now_:
[brokenco.de](https://brokenco.de/).

I feel that [brokenco.de](https://brokenco.de/).  much more accurately captures
the _essence_ of my online brand. And I fully expect to take the next eleven
years just as seriously as the last.
