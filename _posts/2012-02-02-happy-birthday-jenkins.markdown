It's officially been [a year since the first release of
Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/content/happy-birthday-jenkins) went public, and
my what a year.

I'm writing this quick post while waiting at the airport to go to
[FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org) to talk about Jenkins and some of the work that
we've been doing. This comes two weeks after [going to
SCALE10x](http://jenkins-ci.org/event/jenkins-scale-10x-los-angeles) to
advocate and talk to people about Jenkins there.

I am immensely proud of the work everybody in the Jenkins community has done,
and happy to be a part of one of the most welcoming groups of open source
enthusiasts that I've seen yet.


Looking forward to way year number two brings for the project!
