<br/>An informal poll at the <a href="http://www.slide.com">Slide</a> offices this past week yielded these interesting results: at Slide.com, nearly 100% of white people seem to like <a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.wordpress.com">"Stuff White People Like"</a>.<br>
<br>
I must say, I sure do like <a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.wordpress.com/2008/01/29/38-arrested-development/">Arrested Development</a>, <a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.wordpress.com/2008/01/26/28-not-having-a-tv/">not having a tv</a>, <a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.wordpress.com/2008/02/11/63-expensive-sandwiches/">expensive sammiches</a> and <a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.wordpress.com/2008/01/19/7-diversity/">diversity</a>.<br>
