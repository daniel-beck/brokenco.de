Many Mac users around the world are having problems using video chat on iChat AV. The problem is routers or so I hear, every time I try to video chat with some ( sometimes video chat works) i get an error message concerning a communication error -8. When typed into google, there are several people with my same problem, why can't iChat love everyone equally, does it just hate mexicans. Why can't I hit Video Chat and it just works, I can just hope the new OS can fix this or someone can help me. <br>

Sorry Apple I just had to say it,<br>
