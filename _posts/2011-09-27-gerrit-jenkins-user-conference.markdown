In less than seven days I will be standing behind a podium, giving a talk about
[Gerrit and
Jenkins](http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2011-abstracts.cb#RTylerCroy)
that is coming as a result of almost 2 years of integrating Gerrit into two
separate companies, and almost 4 years of Jenkins. The fact that I'm speaking
at the same time as [Sacha Labourey](https://twitter.com/SachaLabourey) (CEO of
[CloudBees](http://cloudbees.com)) is just extra gravy on top of it all.

None of that even touches the surface of a [Jenkins User
Conference](http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2011.cb)
happening, not only happening, but overshooting our original capacity planning
by over 130 people!

Suffice to say, I'm going to be a stressed out and making a lot of final tweaks
to my presentation leading up to it, otherwise I'd just link the PDF here.

If you're interested in attending, you have [less than 24 hours to
register](http://jenkins-user-conference.eventbrite.com/), but even then, we're
so overbooked we might not be able to fit you!

If you cannot make it, my talk will be recorded and posted after all the video
editing and airbrushing is finished.

Hope to see you there, but if I don't, buy me a beer and I'd be happy to talk
you through setting up Gerrit and Jenkins.
