It's been exactly one month since the <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/groups/f8">F8</a> event (Facebook Platform Launch) changed everything, and it's still going. <br>
<br>
Rumor has it that users at some point translate into money, and at some point that money <em>might</em> see my bank account. I'm not holding out hope for this, but it's a novel idea.<br>
<br>
Who would of thought that some of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/610280231/">goofiest ideas I've ever implemented</a> would take off?<br>
<br>
Here's the differences that I've found:<ul><li><strong>Indie Developer:</strong> "Man it'd be cool to have a couple of thousand users"</li><li><strong>Enterprisey Contract Developer:</strong> "Man it'd be cool to have a couple hundred thousand users"</li><li><strong>Startup Developer:</strong> "Man, I hacked up something over the weekend that has a couple of million users. Ho hum, to the pub?"[1]</li></ul><br>
The sheer scale of the market on the web is mind-boggling, despite working for a <a href="http://www.slide.com">web company</a>, I still stand by Todd Manning's comments of "I hate the web, the web is stupid." It's a fact I accept however, I hate Windows as a development platform, but I'm willing to accept that it's too large of a market to ignore (something the guys at <a href="http://plasq.com/">plasq</a> get with both <a href="http://plasq.com/skitch">skitch</a> and <a href="http://plasq.com/comiclife">ComicLife</a>).<br>
<br>
Not three months ago my days were filled with <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">C#</a> and now it's all <a href="http://python.org">python</a> all the time. <br>
<br>
<br>
I'll sleep when the bubble pops.<br>
