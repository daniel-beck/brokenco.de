Another presentation video, this time from [PuppetConf](http://puppetconf.com)
a couple weeks ago.

This presentation was a lot of fun to prepare for a give, since it was nothing
but schadenfreude and beer, two of my favorite things. Most talks at PuppetConf
were 35 minutes, but because he likes me so much
[Mike](https://twitter.com/stahnma) let me run over my time resulting in a
crazy 45 minute talk.
