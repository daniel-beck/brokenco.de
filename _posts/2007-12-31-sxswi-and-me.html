I spoke with Tammy (our <a href="http://www.slide.com/static/about_press" target="_blank">PR mastermind</a>) about whether or not <A href="http://www.slide.com" target="_blank">Slide</a> was going to let me out of my cage to go to <a href="http://sxsw.com/" target="_blank">South by Southwest Interactive</a> this coming March and it seems like they might actually let me! (I'm just as surprised as you are)<br>
<br>
Unfortunately things with Facebook were at such a ridiculous pace when SXSWi was accepting <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_by_category/" target="_blank">panel submissions</a>, that I never got a chance to submit my panel idea: "Slide is awesome, now let's talk about how great Slide is." This leaves me in a slightly awkward position, I cannot remember the last conference or event that I went to where I wasn't speaking or talking or dancing with a baboon in front of a live studio audience. Even at the last SXSWi I was there for about 36 hours and most of that time was spent setting up and then helping run <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampAustinII" target="_blank">BarCamp Austin<sup>2</sup></a>. Ideally I'd like to get on stage with some of the guys from Twitter, Facebook, Bebo, Google and maybe even Myspace to discuss the more open social web that we seem to be moving towards and a bit about how awesome Slide is. It's probably nothing more than a pipe-dream however, since the panels seem to be quite locked down at the moment.<br>
<br>
Of course, if nobody will have me, then I might be relegated to slumming up and down 6th street in Austin hanging out with the usual drunkards that I know in Austin (you know who you are) and getting into trouble. Mmm, trouble.<br>
<br>
Regardless, if you're going to be in Austin for SXSWi let me know, I've got a stack of swanky new business cards I want to get rid of :)<br>
