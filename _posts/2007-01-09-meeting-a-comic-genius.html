Yesterday afternoon at the <a href="http://stephen.paskaluk.com/gallery/FlashFire">Flash Fire Facility</a> we got a visit from <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/mercerreport/">Rick Mercer</a>.  Since it won't be airing for a week or so (and thankfully I won't be in it) I won't yet comment on the stuff we did, but it was pretty cool.  It was a lot more fun than some of the other TV spots we've done (local news, <a href="http://www.discoverychannel.ca/dailyplanet/">Daily Planet</a>).  Rick was pretty cool, and needless to say very funny.  I'd invite him over for a BBQ anyday.
