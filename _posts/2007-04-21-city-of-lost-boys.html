I have struggled to characterize the city of San Francisco ever since first coming out here for a job interview almost a year ago. The city escapes generalization because of the sheer magnitude of intermixing of races, cultures and economic classes, regardless I still am constantly fascinated by San Francisco (that and <a href='http://www.skateboardingbulldog.com/">skateboarding dogs</a> of course). There are two pervailing characteristics about the bay area that I'm noticing already that are only tangentially related, but help make San Francisco the place it is, nobody ever grows up, and it also seems that everyone is a dreamer.<br>
<br>
Despite the obvious age differential between some of my coworkers, and the different types of people that I meet either walking down the street or into a bar, I feel amongst my peers. It is uncanny to come from a place like Texas where the lines between young and old are drawn firmly in the dry, cracking soil, to a place like this where the more traditional boundaries between people have deteriorated. As a weird karmic side-effect, almost everybody seems to be perpetually stuck in their mid-to-late twenties. <br>
<br>
The youthful exuberance that floods over most of the bay area, and Silicon Valley, seem to be one of the many reasons why the topsoil is so welcoming to startups. Like most starry-eyed young people, not yet jaded by the harsh realities of an unforgiving world, so many people here have a dream to strike it rich. Unfortunately, like those that came to this part of California so long ago for the gold contained in the hills, almost nobody will strike gold. But just like birthday presents to your grandmother, it's the thought that counts. <br>
<br>
The perpetual optimism of San Francisco has made it the butt of numerous jokes but also the target of many envious eyes and in general a fun place to be. While it is very possible that <a href="http://buzz.vox.com/">Buzz</a> might be (temporarily) leaving the insanity, I'm thrilled to join in just the same.
