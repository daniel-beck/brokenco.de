If you are a sysadmin, [Open Build Service](https://openbuildservice.org/) is
one of the tools you should add to your toolbox.._today_. "OBS", hosted at
[build.opensuse.org](https://build.opensuse.org) is one of my favorite "killer
apps" for openSUSE, yet for system administrators it has continued to be
relatively unknown, but disproportionately valuable. At a high-level OBS is a tool
for building and distributing packages, but on
[build.opensuse.org](https://build.opensuse.org), there's a social component
which may someday save your bacon!

Today's example was a common situation, one in which I frequently find myself:
I'm want to use a tool which is available in the distribution's packages
but doesn't quite have all features enabled. In today's prototype, I was
tinkering around with [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/) and [Apache
Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) via the
[omkafka](https://rsyslog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/modules/omkafka.html)
module.

One problem: the default `rsyslog` package did not come with `omkafka` enabled,
and `omkafka` was not packaged through another means. Since my test instance
was running openSUSE, I found the [rsyslog
package](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Base:System/rsyslog), branched
it, and [made some minor
changes](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/770738) to build a
`rsyslog-module-kafka` rpm.

But wait! That's not even the cool part!

Using the power of OBS, the project I branched (imagine the
GitHub fork model) started building my changes immediately, and published my
development packages within minutes! Suddenly I was able to have a fully formed
rpm repository with my package in it. One which I could enable in my test
environment and immediately start using!

Rather than fooling around with an entire custom build of `rsyslog`, I spent
around an hour in between a couple of meetings tweaking the official package to
add Kafka support, and then was back to the _real_ work of prototyping!


OBS was well worth the learning curve!
