I meant to post this earlier, but the schedule for the "Configuration and
Systems Management" devroom at FOSDEM 2012 has been posted.

My talk will be [Sunday at
13:00](http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/event/cfgmgmtjenkins) in [Room
K.3.601](http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/room/k3601).

If you're looking for a meaty technical discussion about Puppet this talk will
likely not be for you.

I'm aiming to tell a story more than anything about how our use of Puppet came
to be and has evolved in building out open source project infrastructure.


I hope my talk ends up as light-hearted and entertaining as I'm trying to make
it, in the off chance it doesn't, feel free to heckle and throw fruit.
