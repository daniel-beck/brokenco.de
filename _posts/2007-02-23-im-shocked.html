I'm shocked that anything as simple as a music download site offering popular music (not major label stuff, but still some high profile artists) in <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1719&Itemid=125">unprotected mp3 files</a> could be <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/02/22/tech-puretracksmp3launchissues-20070222.html">done so poorly</a>.  Seriously, how crappy must that system be if they have to force a .wma extension onto the mp3s?  If they have a non-ActiveX download setup what's the deal with Mac downloads?  How hard is it to have a properly descriptive error message for Mac users?<br>
<br>
I can't even come up with words to describe how poorly they've done this.  Has nobody involved with this mess ever actually thought of testing the site?
