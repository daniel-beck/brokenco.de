The Bay Area transit system is what could be compassionately referred to as a
"clusterfuck." SFMTA, AC Transit, Samtrans, Caltrain, Golden Gate Transit,
BART, to name a few of the agencies that *immediately* come to mind. That's not
counting the agencies that run busses and light-rail further down towards Palot
Alto, etc.

Navigating this mess was once incredibly painful, until the Clipper-messiah
came and saved us, sort of. If you're familar with London's [Oyster
Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster_card), or Tokyo's
[Suica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suica) card, Clipper is conceptually
similar but what either of those systems would be like if implemented by the
lowest intoxicated bidder.


I have issues at least once a week, usually with busted card readers, but today
when attempting to add money to my card via a credit card, I saw this:

You might think to yourself "dialing a host? wat!" And you would be right in
your confusion, but this is genuinely what Clipper add-value kiosks show you
when you attempt to use a credit card.

That however was not today's issue! Today, both kiosks were stuck on "dialing a
host.." for about 3-4 minutes, and then the kiosk simply rebooted. A PC BIOS
screen showed up, and some OS started to boot.

I gave up and left.


It's amazing how slow and tedious the future is.
