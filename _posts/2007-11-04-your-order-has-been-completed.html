Yesterday while shopping around for a new cell plan I figured it'd be a good time to get a new phone as well. The cell phone I currently have is the <strong>only</strong> cell phone I've ever owned, I believe the model is an LG Piezza-shit.<br>
<br>
After browsing around Cingular's site, I found a good deal on a Blackberry Pearl and decided I <em>really</em> want to be tethered to my email more than I am now. Not that I ever had any free time to begin with, but I'm a sucker, I liked the placebo effect; that's all over now, I'm getting a Blackberry.<br>
