I thought I'd dork around a little bit with recording videos featuring the Neo1973, running OpenMoko. This video is running an older version of OpenMoko (2007.1) so it isn't current. It's also worth noting, to use the phone, you don't have to do a full shutdown and bootup, you should really only ever need to do either if you're a developer, or when you first receive the phone. <br>
Hello Moko.<br>
