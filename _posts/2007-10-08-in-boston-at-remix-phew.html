After a grueling flight that started with a full-on sprint from the TSA security checkpoint and ended about a quarter mile through the terminal (in socks no less), I have made it across the country to Boston for <a href="http://www.remix07boston.com/">Remix 07 Boston</a>.<br>
<br>
I'm still anxiously awaiting the keynote, and trying to find the Mono guys that are in attendance to try to learn as much as possible about the development and future of Moonlight, while simultaneously trying to learn as much as possible about how other developers are embracing and using Silverlight too.<br>
<br>
If you're at Remix, come find me, I'm a San Franciscan in a rainy Boston, and I'm scared ;)<br>
<br>
I'm this idiot, rocking my "business attire"<br>
