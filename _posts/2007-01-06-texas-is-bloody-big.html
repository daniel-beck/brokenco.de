Almost exactly 333 miles into this trip, and I find myself sitting at a texas rest area (free wireless!). I stopped here about 50% because of the free wireless, and about 50% because I really wanted to see what it felt like to go to the bathroom in 30 degree temperatures.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, thus far the coolest things I've seen are, something on fire on the side of the road, and the moon. West texas isn't really all that exciting. I better get back to cruising though, El Paso is something like 260 miles from here.<br>
<br>
I don't plan on making regular blogging stops, this one just happens to coincide with a more biological deadline. <br>
<br>
Hoping to be through New Mexico by sun up. Eep.<br>
