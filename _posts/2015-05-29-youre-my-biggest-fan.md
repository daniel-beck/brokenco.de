In a previous post I mentioned that [I have become a home
owner](/2015/05/27/mostly-growned-up.html), which dictates that I must now
spend an innumerable number of hours fixing, tinkering and otherwise causing
damage to the home I have purchased. The latest installment of "I bet I can do
that" involved the installation of a 52" ceiling fan in my living room.

After more than a week with temperatures reaching higher than 85F in the living
room, I set out on Saturday to perform the job quickly in between other
scheduled activities. With my wife joining me in the fan selection process, we
made our first trip to Home Depot to select a reasonably priced fan.

### Preparing the installation

Climbing up my green ladder, I began to disassemble the ugly light fixture,
with its single ugly light bulb. I had been lead to believe, by the fan's
installation directions, that I would find a simple outlet box above the ugly
light fixture onto which the fan would be straight-forward to install.

If only!

The ugly light ficture sitting on the painter's plastic below me, I did not
discover an outlet box with a hot, neutral and ground wire but rather a nest of
wires connected together, a [junction
box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junction_box) doubling as a light fixture!
The box also had a circular shape, the diameter of which was simply too small
to affix a mounting bracket to. Adding insult to injury the outlet box had been
secured to the cross-beam (joist) on one side and rested on the drywall on the
other. An insufficient support structure for a ceiling fan to say the least.

**Damnit.**

I hop in the car and head back to Home Depot (**trip number two**) to grab a spanning
brace, which is meant to expand outward between two of the wooden joists in the
ceiling, providing a secure cross-bar from which to install a *new* outlet box.
The spanning brace I bought can be installed by inserting it
through the hole in the ceiling and expanding it from below, making it so the
poor schmoe who's installing the fan doesn't have to get into the attic.

Initially I couldn't make this work because I couldn't unseat the old box to
make a hole, so I scurried into the roof to figure out how to get the old
outlet box out and place the new spanning brace.


Once in the attic I discover that the outlet box isn't visibly secured to the
outlet box from above, but instead there is a tab that sticks out from one side
of the joist behind the box. As my luck would have it, the box had been
**nailed** to the wooden joist from below and then covered with dry-wall. So I
grab my handy-dandy knife and cut an even *bigger* hole in the ceiling.

I make notes of which wires connect where and how and finally got the old
outlet box removed and the spanning brace installed, allowing me to escape from
the insulation-filled hell that protects the house from the 90F heat outside.


### Actually installing the fan

A sufficiently ample hole in my ceiling, dry-wall dust coating both the plastic
sheeting and my lungs, a spanning brace in place and a good night's rest since
the previous day's adventure into the roof, I set out again to install a simple
ceiling fan.

First I had to install the new outlet box to support the fan; only a few bolts
to tighten this quickly got me to the next step in the process. To make sure I
didn't go too far before ensuring the circuit was functional, I rewired the
junction from my notes, connected the old light bulb, flipped the breakers and
the switch and thankfully started lighting the room instead of lighting a fire.

With the fan's mounting bracket attached to the outlet box I quickly realized
the coupling between the fan and the bracket would require tightening screws
just about level with the ceiling. An impossible task with the minimally cut
hole; pulling out my handy-dandy knife again, I made an even bigger hole.

Finally able to secure the fan coupling to the mounting bracket, I finally had
a fan hanging from the ceiling!

I now had a fan and a big hole in the ceiling, meaning **trip number three** was
made to Home Depot to pick up a dry-wall repair kit.

Finishing off the rest of the light installation for the fan was very quick
work and required barely any brain power, which was good because I was running
on fumes at this point.

What I had hoped would be a quick afternoon activity turned into a two-day pain
in the ass, but at least I've got a big fan to keep things cooler now!
