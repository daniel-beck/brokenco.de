After receiving an email a few weeks back about blog spam on my former blog, I decided that I'd go ahead and remove it. About 500 random spam comments later, it's been mostly removed. I'm still wondering if the captcha is <em>that</em> much better for Drupal, or if I've simply not posted anything popular enough to register on the Digg, or O'Reilly blog radars to attract the spam bots? I feel so unloved :)<br>

As a side note, I finally got around to fixing the Drupal mail issue for this site, so if you attempted to register, but never got the confirmation you can request a new password to reset your account. I'm also testing the Twitter Drupal module with this post. Oy.
