As I <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/tyler/twitterbot_no_really_i_need_to_be_stopped">previously mentioned</a>, I've written a small C# application called "Twitterbot" that grabs items from an RSS feed and retrofits them for <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>. After discussing it with some of the folks over at twitter, they have no problem with me open sourcing the litte bot, so I give you, <a href="http://trac.geekisp.com/bleep/wiki/Twitterbot">the Twitterbot</a>. <br>
<br>
I also added a few fixes this morning after adding the <a href="http://twitter.com/hybridized">hybridized</a> twitter-thing:<ul><li>Improved duplication checks</li><li>Refresh slow-downs between 12:00 and 6:00 am (exclusive)</li><li>Better error handling</li><li>A few comments :)</li></ul><br>
The Twitterbot can be downloaded from the subversion repository, details are located on the <a href="http://trac.geekisp.com/bleep/wiki/Twitterbot">Twitterbot's page</a>. The Twitterbot is <a href="http://trac.geekisp.com/bleep/wiki/BSD_License">BSD licensed</a> and will run with both .NET and <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono</a>. Enjoy!
