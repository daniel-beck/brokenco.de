I try to separate my political leanings from my work, especially when it comes to blogging, etc, but this is too much. The <a href="http://www.reflector.com/local/content/news/stories/2007/02/19/roll_call.html">House passed non-binding resolution on Iraq</a> which is the latest in the long list of completely neutered actions by our legislative branch. <br>
<br>
It's not a question of "supporting the troops" or "protecting the children" or "stopping terrorism" if you don't have the <strong>spine</strong> to keep the executive branch in check (what a quaint idea) <strong>resign</strong> so we can find somebody who isn't an absolute coward. Regardless of which side you lean towards politically, <strong>any</strong> executive branch that's given carte blanche is dangerous.
