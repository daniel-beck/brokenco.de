A few weekends ago ET and I had some engagement photos taken, I'm told this is normal, by the husband-and-wife team from [Tibidabo Photography](http://tibidabophotography.com/), Bob and Becky. The duo met us at one of my favorite spots in San Francisco: <a id="aptureLink_bEhQfgpdTP" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;f=q&amp;ll=37.7694001%2C-122.4290676&amp;hl=en&amp;z=15&amp;ie=UTF8">Duboce Ave and Buena Vista Ave East</a> 
 after which we ran around in Buena Vista Park taking a few shots, then down to <a id="aptureLink_zw8zgzu7xR" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;f=q&amp;ll=37.7943737%2C-122.4833053&amp;hl=en&amp;z=14&amp;ie=UTF8">Baker Beach</a>. As much as I **hate** having my picture taken, they did a wonderful job and grabbed some really stellar shots.
