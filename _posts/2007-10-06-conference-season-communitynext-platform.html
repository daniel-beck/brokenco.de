As luck would have it, I'm currently masquerading as <a href="http://max.slide.com" target="_blank">Max</a> at <a href="http://www.communitynext.com" arget="_blank">CommunityNext</a> in Sunnyvale. The underlying drive behind the entire event is to discuss some of the intricacies behind a locked-down platform like Facebook's. CommunityNext is interesting in that Noah Kagan, one of the organizers, did a <em>really</em> good job of finding, and bringing a lot of the upper tier Facebook Platform developers to Silicon Valley from Philadelphia, Boston, New York City, etc. <br>
<br>
If nothing else, CommunityNext is rumored to have great parties, and there just so happens to be a <a href="http://www.communitynext.com/schedule/" target="_blank">BBQ later today</a> down here in Sunnyvale. It's somewhat late to suggest that everybody I know to attend, so I'll just mention that you're missing some good fun in South Bay, and leave it at that.
