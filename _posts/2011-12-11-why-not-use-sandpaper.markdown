My wife occasionally gets annoyed with my constant analysis and experimentation
with just about everything. I have this incessant need to find the try to find
improvements in everything that I do. For example, when boarding my train to
head home in the evening, I board at just the right place such that I exit at
the base of the stairs upon arrival. Not that big of a deal, but I like to walk
stairs two at a time and all getting stuck behind all the slow tiny people was
infuriating.

I'm all about constant improvement, whether it be for speed, quality, etc, you
get the point.


With that said, here's a recommendation I have for you:

Next time you find yourself thinking "good work toilet paper, I think we're
done here." Use one or two of things and enjoy realizing how long you and
everybody around you has been walking around with dirty asses.
