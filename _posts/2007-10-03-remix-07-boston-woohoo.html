Turns out I'll be attending <a href="http://www.remix07boston.com/" target="_blank">Remix 07 Boston</a> next week but unfortunately my mega-cool-Silverlight hack won't be finished due to some scheduling complexities involved with working 130% of my time at a <a href="http://www.slide.com" target="_blank">start-up in San Francisco</a> (turns out, not too conducive to side-projects). I will be arriving bright and early at 6:30a.m. pounding down a gigantic (and expensive) airport coffee, and then heading to the Hyatt Regency Cambridge, so I apologize in advance if I look exceedingly tired Monday morning.<br>
<br>
It'll be a great opportunity to get a feel for where Microsoft thinks that Silverlight is going, and how they intend to get there. It's a long hard road to even become <strong>near</strong> where Flash is in terms of market entrenchment, but Microsoft is one of three companies I believe currently capable of acheiving it (the other two being Adobe itself [bought Macromedia, they cheated], and Apple).<br>
<br>
I would also like to give those <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/r_tyler_ballance/popfly_how_to_lose_the_buzz" target="_blank">Popfly guys an earful</a> but I may spare them depending on how busy I am trying to find some fellow Facebook developers that live in the Boston area, or <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/" target="_blank">Miguel</a>, who I'm pretty sure doesn't exist, but is merely a robotic creation of some wacky laboratory in Mexico.<br>
<br>
If you'd like to meetup and have lunch, or a beer in the evening Monday or Tuesday, feel free to send me at email (tyler@slide.com) or track me down during the actual conference (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/419361757/" target="_blank">i'm this guy</a>).<br>

Special thanks to Anand for what us young-folk call "the hook-ups" and I look forward to seeing both of my blog readers in Boston next week ;)
