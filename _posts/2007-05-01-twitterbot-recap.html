While trudging through some comment spam, I came across some older comments that I felt needed recapping in <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/tyler/twitterbot_no_really_i_need_to_be_stopped">this post about my Twitterbot</a>. An anonymous poster had asked about some issues with Mono on Mac OS X returning 401 Unauthorized errors when using HTTP authentication within the <a href="http://trac.geekisp.com/bleep/wiki/Twitterbot">Twitterbot</a>. The issue was fixed relatively quickly after I brought it to the attention of some of the Mono developers, and the fix will be included in <a href="http://mono.ximian.com/monobuild/preview/download-preview/">Mono 1.2.4</a> (preview available). <br>
<br>
There shouldn't be any more issues with regards to running the Twitterbot on any platform supported by Mono now. In the future I would also like to add better history and duplicate checking by using either a flat-file datasource or one that feeds on a database, but the latter would probably make the program far more complex and difficult to use. Ideas, as usual, are always welcome.
