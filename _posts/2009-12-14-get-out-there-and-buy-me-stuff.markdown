A weekend or two ago I sat down and created an Amazon wishlist of stuff that I would like to purchase. In the past I've found Amazon wishlists an ideal way of saying thanks to a number of folks in the open source community whose work I value, at one point I didn't desire any new gadgets and went through a large number of gift cards buying goodies for some of my favorite hackers on Amazon.

Get out there and buy (me) stuff, our economy depends on it.
