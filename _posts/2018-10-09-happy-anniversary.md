One year ago today, I watched the Sonoma county fires pour over Shiloh ridge
towards the Fountaingrove neighborhood. I wrote about the experience, and
subsequent evacuation in in "[Watching fire
come down the mountain](/2017/10/09/fire-coming-down-the-mountain.html)".
The response across Sonoma county to the fires was as monumental as the fires
themselves, and for my part, I spent the next two weeks working with old and
new friends to build and support [Sonoma Fire Info](http://sonomafireinfo.org)
to strive to get as much accurate information to our fellow residents as
possible.

When we decided to close down our flash-mob style activism, I wrote a bit more
about the scope of the fires and some of my experience in "[This is your
reality now](/2017/10/23/this-is-reality.html)."

We were fortunate not to be directly impacted, but impact of the fire is within
arms length for everybody up here. The woman who led some classes my wife and I
attended earlier this year, lost her house in Glen Ellen. My former next door
neighbor, who helped me with my truck every now and again, moved because he was
finally able to buy a house in Coffey Park. My friend's uncle lost his house up
off Mark West Springs Rd, being under-insured to rebuild in Sonoma county, he
moved his family and business to Oregon. Just last week, one of the guys
helping to clean up [our water
damage in the office](/2018/10/08/setbacks-for-startup-sonoma-county.html),
mentioned that he had also lost his house in Coffey Park. For the weeks I
worked on Sonoma Fire Info, I lived and breathed disaster response and
fire information dissemination. Much of that time is imprinted in my memory
unlike many other experiences before it.

For many of us, there are two Sonoma counties: that which was before, and that
which was after the fires.

Suffice it to say, October 9th changed me.

Seven and one years ago today, I stood on a grassy hill overlooking vineyards
somewhere in Sonoma county, surrounded on one side by a raucous group of
friends and on the other by a raucous group of family. Heart pounding beneath
the only properly fitting suit I own, my wife and I married.

When I think about the man I was then, I can only smile at how much our
relationship has changed us both for the better. I share with every friend who
will listen some of my thoughts on the value and importance of marriage. I can
safely say that neither of us would have grown to be the people we are today
without one another. And we continue to learn and challenge each other with
each passing day. The commitment isn't simply to each other, but to the more
abstract concept of "us", which helped me understand and prioritize so much
differently than I did before.

Our things, our house, our future, our family. Our life together.

Suffice it to say, October 9th changed me.
