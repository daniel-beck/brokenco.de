Today the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](http://cd.foundation) officially launches, marking the
completion of almost two years of work. Starting at the 2017 Jenkins World
Contributor Summit where we, the [Jenkins project](https://jenkins.io) discussed a "Jenkins Software Foundation", to the
2018 Open Source Leadership Summit where the concept evolved into a continuous
delivery focused organization, culminating in what we have today: a strong
group of organizations and initial projects banding together for under the
banner of the Continuous Delivery Foundation ([CDF](http://cd.foundation)).


When I first [wrote about CDF](/2019/01/31/lets-go-cdf.html) in January, I
highlighted some of the reasons that I am excited for the organization. The
list has since gotten even longer! The Jenkins project's meager budget is
currently spent on our infrastructure, travel grants, and initiatives like
[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/). Under the CDF, I am excited
to scale up our investments in the Jenkins and broader continuous delivery
community. Imagining the world in which we could fund not just one OUtreachy
intern, but **two**! Or funding more travel grants to ensure that members from
our global community can join in events like
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org), or [DevOps World Jenkins
World](http://jenkinsworld.com). I can hardly wait!

The excitement of a predictable budget is only half of the story however. As we
have worked towards the CDF with our peers at Google, Netflix, and a number of
other companies, we have already found really interesting points to further
collaborate within the CD ecosystem. One really interesting idea that has come
up has been the possibility of a shared model for a "cd pipeline." A model
which can be used between Jenkins, Jenkins X, Spinnaker, Tekton, and other
tools involved in the process.


Over the past 10+ years in the Jenkins community, I have always been
passionate about the project's community, governance, and planning for the
future. With Jenkins and the CDF, I'm looking forward to us building for the
next 10+ years of Jenkins!
