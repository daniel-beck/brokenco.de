As I <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/r_tyler_ballance/graphing_social_building_your_first_app_workshop" target="_blank">previously mentioned</a>, I'll be teaching a workshop on "developing your first Facebook application" tomorrow at the <a href="http://graphingsocial.com/" target="_blank">Graphing Social</a> conference in San Jose. I figured, what better way to explain building your first Facebook app then to write one! Why the hell not right? So last thursday night I cleaned the dust off my pathetic PHP skills and set to work to create an application in a couple hours, that I could use as a tool for teaching the "basics" of Facebook application development.<br>

<h3>Behold, awesomeness</h3><br>

<a href="http://apps.facebook.com/whyareyouawesome" target="_blank">Why are you awesome?</a> is a relatively simple application that follows the self-importance of Twitter, but adds the "social graph", and voting capabilities. Using "Why are you awesome?" I hope to convey in a marginally basic sense some of the core concepts behind rendering FBML pages, making use of notifications/feed posts/invitations and Mock AJAX from the profile.<br>
<br>
I won't disclose too much before the presentation (not that anybody will see this before the presentation), but I'm <strong>extremely</strong> happy with what about 4 hours of morning hacking has garnered me, and the possibilities of the application.<br>
<br>
You know what, let's see that super-mega-hot interface one more time.<br>
