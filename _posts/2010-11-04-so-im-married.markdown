A few weeks ago I finally tied the knot after a rather long engagement, putting my relationship with then-fiance&eacute; into a legally binding relationship. While a wedding should hold a very special place in the bride and groom's heart forever, I feel like it is safe to say that our wedding **objectively rocked.**

I don't want to dive too much into the nitty-gritty details of the entire weekend which culminated in a great ceremony and reception at the phenomenal [Madrona Manor](http://madronamanor.com/) Restaurant and Inn. The entire atmosphere, from both families having a great time together, to impeccable weather and the fantastically prepared dinner, was damned near perfect. Cue a brief slideshow of pictures taken by my good friends [Dave Young](http://twitter.com/stuffonfire) and [Annika Lindner](http://twitter.com/Artichoke13):

Now that we're properly married, and no longer engaged, the typical annoying question has changed from "**When are you getting married?**" to "**When are you having children?**" 

Considering I can barely take care of our [big moron of a cat](http://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/tags/cat/), I don't think children are in the cards anytime soon.  I'm curious what milestone comes after children though, "when are you going to retire" might be next and then perhaps "when are you going to die" after that.



Either way, I think it's safe to say, it's all down hill from here.
