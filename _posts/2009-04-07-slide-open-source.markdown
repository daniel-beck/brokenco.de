It's not been a secret that I'm a big fan of open source software, I would likely not be where I am today had I not started with projects like [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org) or [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org) way back when. While my passion for open source software and the "bazaar" method of developing software might not be shared by everybody at [Slide, Inc](http://slide.com), everybody can certainly get on board with the value of incorporating open source into our stack, which is almost entirely comprised of [Python](http://www.python.org) (and an assortment of other web technologies).

Along those lines, there's been some amount of discussion about what we can or should open source from what we've developed at [Slide](http://www.slide.com), but we've not really *pushed* anything out into the ether as of yet. Today however, I think we finally put our foot in the door as far as contributing back to the open source community as a whole, **we're now on [GitHub](http://www.github.com) as "[slideinc](http://github.com/slideinc/)"**, yay! (coincidentally we have a [slideinc](http://twitter.com/slideinc) twitter account too)

Currently the only project that's come directly out of Slide, and shared via the **slideinc** GitHub account is [PyVE](http://github.com/slideinc/pyve/tree), a Python Virtual Earth client that I hacked together recently to tinker with some Geocoding (released under a 3-clause BSD license). In the (hopefully) near future we'll continue to open source some other components we've either created or extended internally.

If you're not a GitHub user, you should definitely check GitHub out, it's a pretty impressive site. If you are a GitHub user, or a Python developer, you should "follow" the [slideinc](http://github.com/slideinc/) user on GitHub to catch the cool stuff that we may or may not ever actually release ;)
