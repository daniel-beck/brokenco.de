One of the most significant personal revelations I have had in the past five
years has been around the relevance and importance of high-quality engineering
management and leadership. From my observations, poor engineering leadership has a negative
and cascading effect throughout the product development process, and can
substantially improve or degrade the overall performance of the company. As I have [previously
written](/2017/09/19/management-coaching.html), I now appreciate how
engineering leadership is a specific skill set which requires practice, growth,
and it's own specialization.

For my own growth, I have found books to be useful from the domains of: 
general management, executive management practices, leadership, and product
management. I haven't found much really compelling that is _specific_ for
engineering management and have instead resorted to pattern-matching and
pilfering ideas from other industries. What I have found most useful have been
books on general leadership practices and principles.

I prefer to think of my job as _leadership_ not management. Management is what
we do when we're overseeing a complex machine. Leadership is what we do when
we're overseeing and working with complex groups of people. I find that helps
reframe the job from pulling levers and pushing buttons, to one of politics and
persuasion.

This list is certainly not comprehensive and is wholly based on **my opinion**.

I am currently pulling together an informal group of remote engineering
managers and leaders across companies. I'm hoping that by creating a
peer-support group, we will be able to help each other grow and solve problems.
If this strikes you as interesting, please email me (rtyler@) and say hello!
