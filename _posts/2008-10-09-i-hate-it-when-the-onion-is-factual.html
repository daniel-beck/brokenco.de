I saw this referenced by an op-ed piece I read in a restaurant a few weeks back and had to share, as it's become more and more depressing.<br>
<br>
This is a piece run by The Onion on January 17, 2001 shortly after George W. Bush came into office netitlted: <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784" target="_blank">Bush: 'Our Long National Nightmare Of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over</a><br/><center><img src="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/unethicalblogger.com/images/national_nightmare.jpeg"/></center><br>
<br>
I'm going to go cry in a corner now.
