I figured I'd write up a guide to building Mono from Subversion in preparation of the upcoming 1.2.6 release, on a site I've neglected since I set it up, <a href="http://mononews.org">mononews.org</a> (I hope to get back to writing tutorials and "newsy" stuff with the 1.2.6 release).<br>
<br>
Anyways, if you've got Leopard installed, Geoff Norton did a great job in helping me track down the remaining Leopard/i386 bugs earlier today, so now you can build and run Mono relatively easily from Subversion on your fancy smancy new OS.<br>
