I have been exploring the wide world of [Behavior Driven
Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development) lately
with [Cucumber](http://cukes.info). For the longest time I've been fascinated
with Cucumber from a conceptual standpoint; a written-word testing framework,
do go on! I'm quite pleased to finally be able to put it to good use with some
recent [projects](https://github.com/rtyler/jenkins-selenium-tests) that I've been working on.


The **only** downside I've found, thus far for Cucumber comes down to the
use of the term "cukes" to describe Cucumber-based tests.

The word "cuke" or "cukes" simply has an unpleasant, wretched feeling to it. It
sounds like something unpleasant to get on your shoes. I really do not like
this word.


As such, I will henceforth refer to Cucumber-based tests as "*gherkins*" instead.

I look forward to writing plenty of posts in the future about creating high
quality gherkins for browser testing and cross-system testing, stay tuned!
