After a few solid months of staying within the city limits of San Francisco hacking to my heart's content on a few Facebook products, my OpenMoko, some Mono libraries that I'm building, and other stuff I shouldn't talk about, I'm taking a break.<br>
<br>
A friend of mine has taken my advice and is moving to the west coast now that she's graduated and is ready to see what the world has to offer outside of Boston. Part of my obligation it would seem as the giver of (<strong>fantastic</strong>) advice is that I will now help her drive 2,968 miles from Washington D.C., to Santa Barbera.<br>
<br>
I'm debating buying a camera once I arrive in D.C. later today. If anybody has any suggestions for reasonably priced, good digital cameras, please let me know.<br>
<br>
This should be fun.<br>
