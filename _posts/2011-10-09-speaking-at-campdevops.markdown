**Disclaimer:** I dislike "*devops*" as a term in general. The tools and
practices that are associated with "devops" however (puppet, chef, continuous
deployment, automation of ops, etc) I am a **very** big fan of.

Not satisfied to speak at [one big
event](/2011/09/27/gerrit-jenkins-user-conference.html) this month, I will also be
speaking/hosting [a workshop](http://campdevops.com/speakers#tyler-croy) at [CampDevOps](http://campdevops.com/sessions) on
October 22nd in Chicago.


As you might guess, the subject of the workshop will be primarily focused on
Jenkins with a bit of Gerrit thrown in for good measure. Unlike my talk at the
Jenkins User Conference, this will be much more demo/workshop oriented.

Unfortunately I will not have enough time (2 hours) to really run things like a
workshop and engage with everybody on a 1:1 level. Due to the time constraints,
it will be much more of a protracted-demo with slides intermixed and Q&A
interspersed.

In other words, I'm not sure how it's going to turn out, but I know the subject
matter well enough that I think we'll be able to get a lot of information
across in the time allotted.


If you're going to be in Chicago, you've only got a few more days to [register
for the early bird](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2061143937) discount, so
get that locked down!


See you there!
