Good news everyone! This site can now be accessed via a
[Tor Onion Service](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/).
While the main site `brokenco.de` is served via GitHub Pages for HTTP, the
entirety of this content is also available at the following onion (v3) service:

**[brokencosohcv73p6vohqdz65vnbk5nqjuifjhepcedignejajswinad.onion](http://brokencosohcv73p6vohqdz65vnbk5nqjuifjhepcedignejajswinad.onion)**

I have also added the
[Onion-Location](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/advanced/onion-location/)
`meta http-equiv` tag, which can allow the Tor Browser to _automatically_ switch the the onion service when you navigate to `brokenco.de`.

This affects the Gopher service I operate as well, which can be accessed at: `gopher://brokencosohcv73p6vohqdz65vnbk5nqjuifjhepcedignejajswinad.onion`

Enjoy!
