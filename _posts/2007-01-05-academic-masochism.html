Interesting <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070104173624769">post on Groklaw</a> about freely available "courseware".  The <a href="http://www.ocwconsortium.org/index.html">OpenCourseWare Consortium</a> seems like a fantastic idea to me.  Academia is really all about sharing knowledge.<br>
<br>
I've already bookmarked the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mechanical-Engineering/index.htm">MIT Mechanical Engineering page</a>, though I can usually find comparable material in <a href="http://www.engineering.ualberta.ca/mece/">my own department</a>.
