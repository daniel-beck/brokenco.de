The impact of HIV/AIDS on the world is difficult to overlook, perhaps more so
in the San Francisco bay area where the epidemic decimated the gay community in
the 80's and 90's. While not directly affected, I have supported AIDS-related
organizations and legislation in San Francisco and California at large ever
since I moved here over a decade ago. This year I will be trying something of
a slightly different color: [AIDS/LifeCycle](http://www.aidslifecycle.org/).
An event which brings thousands of cyclists, roadies, and supporters together
to ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles, raising millions of dollars in the
process. This year, rather than donating to friends' fundraising activities,
**[I will be joining them!](http://tofighthiv.org/goto/rtyler)**.

My journey officially started _this week_, first by taking the plunge and
signing up. Next up was taking some time off of work to go get properly fitted
with my commuter/road bike so that I can start training [once the smoke
clears](/2018/11/10/the-air-is-fire.html) for the **545 miles in five days** of
exciting cycling between San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The meager fundraising goal which I have set for myself is **$5,000**. That's
not huge, but $5,000 which the [San Francisco AIDS
Foundation](http://www.sfaf.org) and the [Los Angeles LGBT
Center](http://www.lalgbtcenter.org) can use to provide preventive care, free
testing, condoms, and to keep a number of other support services operational in
our northern and southern California communities.

It has been less than a week and I am already amazed by the support by some
friends and family who have donated to the cause. From the bigger donations to
the smallest, like a few $10 donations from some college students I know,
**everything** is appreciated and will be put to good use to help **end AIDS**.

Between now and next June, I will continue to blog about my training and
progress. I'm incredibly excited to see how much we can raise for
AIDS/LifeCycle 2019.


The team I have joined, [Team
ALCaholics](http://www.tofighthiv.org/site/TR/Events/AIDSLifeCycleCenter?pg=team&fr_id=2110&team_id=19101),
have set an ambituous but attainable goal of $400,000 this year, and I really
would appreciate your help in getting us there!

My donation page, and fundraising progress, can be found
**[here](http://tofighthiv.org/goto/rtyler)**.

I hope you will join me, and thousands of other supporters, to end AIDS!
