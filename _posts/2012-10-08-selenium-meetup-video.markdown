A few weeks ago I had the fortune to speak at the [SF Selenium
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/seleniumsanfrancisco/) with a talk titled:
"*Better Late than Never: Integrating Selenium After The Fact*".


This talk is part of a larger Lookout narrative that I've discussed
before around our epic journey to continuous deployment. Alongside some of the
process changes we've enabled, we've also addressed a huge backlog of missing
browser tests which has helped raise our confidence level before shipping code.


The talk might be a bit rambly, but I hope you find it useful.
