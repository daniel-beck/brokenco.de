Just over a week ago I returned from a trip to Tokyo for the [Jenkins User
Conference 2012 - Tokyo](http://build-shokunin.org/juc2012/). I attended the
summer [Developers Summit](http://codezine.jp/devsumi/) and a Jenkins hackathon
while I was in Tokyo, but JUC 2012 was the main event.


I can't say enough good things about the Japanese Jenkins community, they are
as friendly (if not more so) as all of the other hackers, users and testers
that I've met throughout the years working with the project. My only regret is
that I had to take so much of [Kohsuke's](https://github.com/kohsuke) time for
translation or assistance due to the language barrier.


The talk that I gave at JUC Tokyo was titled "Rebuilding the airplane at
10,000m. Continuous Deployment with Jenkins and Gerrit"

I've uploaded my materials:

* [Slides without notes (pdf)](https://github.com/rtyler/juc-tokyo-presentation/raw/master/juc-tokyo.pdf)
* [Slides with notes (pdf)](http://strongspace.com/rtyler/public/juc-tokyo-notes.pdf)
* [Source "code" for the presentation](https://github.com/rtyler/juc-tokyo-presentation)


Unfortunately I don't yet have the video to post, so for now you'll have to
take my word when I say the talk went well.


I look forward to traveling to Tokyo again next year to enjoy the heat, Soba
and to try more of whatever delicious food [Sotoru](https://twitter.com/cynipe)
and Takashi try to feed me.
