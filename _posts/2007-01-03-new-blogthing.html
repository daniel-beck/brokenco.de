After talking with <a href="http://www.hinkty.com">Phil Aaronson</a> about a recent rant of mine (<a href="http://bleepsoft.com/tyler/index.php?itemid=122">Bribing Bloggers, Better</a>) I found out that this domain was available and couldn't resist the temptation. I've been meaning to move to a Drupal-based blogthing for quite some time, and the perfect storm of the domain being available and having a brief moment of free time combined with $9 led to the creation of <a href="http://www.unethicalblogger.com">unethical blogger</a>.<br>
<br>
My own personal blog URL on the site is <a href="http://www.unethicalblogger.com/blog/tyler">http://www.unethicalblogger.com/blog/tyler</a> and I've left open user registration, so you too can have an unethical blog! For example, if I were a Vista shill, I could magically register the username "vistashill" and have an unethical blog at http://www.unethicalblogger.com/blog/vistashill and well, you get the point. I'm going to leave this open and see where it takes me, I am not putting ads on this site, but I must mention the hosting is provided ever-so-graciously by my (good?) friend <a href="http://dave.redterror.net">Dave Steinberg</a> over at <a href="http://www.geekisp.com">GeekISP</a> (GeekISP also happens to host the <a href="http://trac.geekisp.com/bleep">bleep subversion repository</a>, amongst other things).<br>
<br>
I've had better, but I've also had much worse ideas, we'll see where unethical blogging takes me.
