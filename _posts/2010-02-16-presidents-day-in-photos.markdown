While I don't carry a decent camera around with me, I've found that the camera in my Samsung Jack is usually decent enough if I can hold my hands still (*rare*). Ended up snapping a few photos today and wanted to post them with a little bit of story behind them.

My bike route to the office takes me up and down <a id="aptureLink_gl5mNnD6Dc" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;f=q&amp;ll=37.7722061%2C-122.4372057&amp;hl=en&amp;z=15&amp;ie=UTF8">Page St.</a> which runs into Market St. just on the other side of Van Ness Ave. I never saw the accident or another car, I just saw a couple of cops and tow-truck guys standing around this flipped car on the turn from inbound <a id="aptureLink_dfAkNoPcko" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?om=0&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;f=q&amp;ll=37.7901599%2C-122.4239789&amp;hl=en&amp;z=15&amp;ie=UTF8">Market St. onto Franklin St.</a> I didn't see any damage on the vehicle so I'm still quite puzzled how it was flipped and which direction it could have possibly been heading.

I picked these two figures up from <a id="aptureLink_zbHNBxGVkx" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidrobot">Kid Robot</a> for Apture's Christmas Secret Santa, they ended up going to <a id="aptureLink_EXSu8L56ok" href="http://twitter.com/jjstern">Josh</a> who didn't take them with him for whatever reason. I've since moved them to a more visible location (right below the Hudson dashboard).

Given the cloud cover that I normally ride home through I was quite surprised to see clear skies *over* <a id="aptureLink_DGc7D8CSsA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin%20Peaks%20%28San%20Francisco%2C%20California%29">Twin Peaks</a> on my ride home. Of course, it is still February, so the clouds were still there, creeping along the ground.
