So today I began what I hope is a great experience at Texas A&M University, but as I walk through the freezing cold weather and enter my first class I realize I have entered a different world. This has nothing to do with the amout of work or toughieness of the classes ( liked my bushism there... heh heh), its getting used to saying Howdy. Howdy, who the dues says howdy...., people dont say hi here, they say howdy.... what is with this, plus depending on how you say it howdy can sound very (insert brokeback mountain joke here). Well lets just hope things work out, i may just revolt and just say, hi. <br>
<br>
whatever<br>
<br>
As always I am the roy
