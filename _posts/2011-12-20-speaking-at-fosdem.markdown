This upcoming February I will be making the trip to the bitterly cold
cobblestoned streets of Brussels, Belgium for [FOSDEM
2012](http://fosdem.org/2012/), one of the most fantastic open source
conferences of the entire year.

I've been to FOSDEM once before, but as a timid young lad who barely spoke to
anybody. I distinctly recall walking down a hallway past [Theo de Raadt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_de_Raadt)
thinking "ZOMG IT'S THEO" then in the most sauve fashion, I turned around and
walked back down the hallway in the opposite direction making sure I got a good look at Theo.

What a damn nerd.

This year will be something special in that I will be speaking in the
[Configuration Management Devroom](http://fosdem.puppetlabs.com/) on the
subject: "*Open Source Infrastructure - Running the Jenkins project with Puppet and
more*.

If you're not familiar with the structure of FOSDEM, there are a two main
tracks which are held in amphitheaters which can hold hundreds of people at a
time. The only one of these I remember from my last visit was watching a talk
by [Alan Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Cox), to give you an idea of
the scale of those sessions.

Concurrent to the main tracks there are a number of topic-oriented "devrooms"
where developers of common interests (Mono, MySQL, Open source virtualization,
etc) congregate for talks, panels, etc.

My talk is structured as a hybrid technical/case study talk, the abstract of
which is below:

> In early 2011 the Jenkins project became the Jenkins project, leaving behind an
> organically grown but Oracle (formerly Sun) operated infrastructure.  An open
> source project with thousands of users had to grow an infrastructure
> practically overnight, initially doing things "the wrong way" by hand crafting
> machines. That was until a costly mistake forced us to reconsider and migrate
> to managing our infrastructure with Puppet from a publicly available shared Git
> repository.
>
> Besides Puppet, the Jenkins project also uses a number of other tools to help
> manage access control on GitHub, parts of JIRA, etc, all carrying on the very
> transparent and welcoming tradition the project prides itself on.
>
> In this talk I will discuss the ups and downs of switching an established
> infrastructure to Puppet, all within the public eye and with volunteer time and
> energy.

If you're in Europe next February, I highly recommend making the pilgramage to
FOSDEM, and be sure to come up and say "hi!" I promise I don't bite.
