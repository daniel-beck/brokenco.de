Early this week [Can](http://twitter.com/cansar) forwarded [this post on Quora](http://www.quora.com/Is-programming-with-Twisted-really-as-awful-as-it-sounds) to me, which asks the question:

> Is programming with Twisted really as awful as it sounds?

Yes. *Yes*. **YES IT IS**. ***HOLY CRAP IT'S AWFUL***

Here's some good alternatives:

 * [Eventlet](http://eventlet.net), my preference
 * [gevent](http://gevent.org), an alternative to Eventlet tied to libevent
 * [Java](http://www.java.com/). because let's face it, if you're using Twisted, you've already decided not to write Python, so use something with proper threading support.

That is all.
