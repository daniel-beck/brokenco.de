I learned [this
morning](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.ada/ySdhKspI-8o) that a good man by the name of [Jacob Sparre
Andersen](https://github.com/sparre)
passed away over the weekend. While Jacob (sparre) is not the first person
I know of to have died in the open source community, he is the
first I interacted with on some frequency. A constant presence in the Ada developer
community, most often I would chat with him in `#ada` on the Freenode network
but we would also see each other once a year at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org).

sparre was a tall lanky Dane with a slow, methodical, and deep voice who
patiently shared all the knowledge and experience he had with the newbies and
experienced hands alike. I don't believe I _ever_ saw a negative comment
towards, or about anybody, from sparre. His ever present willingness to
**help** is a behavior I envy, and wish I emulated more often than I actually
do.

Recently while cleaning out some old files, I ran across a demo repository he
had shared with me in direct response to a question I had asked in `#ada`
around potential plugin architectures for Ada. I made a mental note "this is
really good code, I don't want to lose track of it!" before returning to my
hacking.

His positivity, willingness to listen, desire to help, and ability to share not
only made sparre a great developer, but a good person.

The Ada community just won't be the same without him.
