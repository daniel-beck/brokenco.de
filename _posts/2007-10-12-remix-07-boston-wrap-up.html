Earlier this week, following <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/r_tyler_ballance/conference_season_communitynext_platform">CommunityNext</a> and <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/r_tyler_ballance/graphing_social_building_your_first_app_workshop">Graphing Social</a> I was lucky enough to have been asked out to Boston for <a href="http://www.remix07boston.com/">Remix 07 Boston</a>. After receiving the necessary flack from my co-workers at <a href="http://www.slide.com">Slide</a> (primarily a Python/Linux shop), I boarded a plane late Sunday night to arrive <strong>extremely</strong> early on Monday morning (6a.m. isn't my best hour). <br>
<br>
Upon arrival to the Hyatt Regency Cambridge, I found out that I had access to the Media Room, which allowed me to recharge my laptop and plug into a hard-wired connection such that I was able to write up a <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/r_tyler_ballance/in_boston_at_remix_phew">few</a> <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/r_tyler_ballance/miguel_questions_the_manhood_of_400_microsoft_developers_awesome">blog</a> <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/r_tyler_ballance/miguel_de_icazas_remix_07_boston_keynote_address">posts</a> from the conference itself. Having such access also allowed me to work on some sample Silverlight applications that I'll write up over the weekend covering Silverlight and IronPython. <br>
<br>
While I enjoyed the sessions, such as Miguel's session on Moonlight and Mono and another session on the DLR and dynamic languages, what I enjoyed most was the ability to pick the brains of some of the folks there. Specifically guys like <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/">Aaron Brethorst</a>, who works a lot on Microsoft Popfly's interface among other things, who let me question just about everything under the sun with regards to Popfly while still maintaining that I really like the application and its potential.<br>
<br>
I also really enjoyed meeting up with <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/index.html">Miguel</a> and his crew at Novell (<a href="http://abock.org/">Aaron Bockover</a> and <a href="http://mjhutchinson.com/journal/category/mono/0">Michael Hutchinson</a>) after Miguel was kind enough to take me to a late lunch and then show me around Novell's Boston office. I also think Miguel successfully guilted me into contributing more code that I've been putting off for so long, like my Mono.Nat NAT-PMP code, Mono.Facebook.Platform, and some patches for System.Web.Script.Serialization; all of which I have neglected in the difficult search for a good night's rest, or the perfect ping-pong serve against co-workers.<br>
<br>
I still look and feel mostly dead from exhaustion, but not dead enough not to continue pounding away on <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/topeight/">everybody's favorite Facebook app</a>, or working on some of the other really cool things that we work on here at Slide (<a href="http://www.slide.com/pic_arrange">bubble text!</a>). In the valley, everybody knows who Slide is now, everybody knows what's going on with Facebook, and an extremely small subset of people that matter know who I am; but on the east coast, far fewer understand what's going on right now on "that college social network, right?"<br>
<br>
Miguel said he doesn't install Facebook applications citing the near-complete opacity of the security and data-storage policy to the end-user, but maybe now that he's met me, and knows who's behind it, he'll install Top Friends and I'll finally be able to claim that Miguel uses something that I wrote, instead of the usual case of vice versa.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note to self:</strong> Travel back to Boston, soon.
