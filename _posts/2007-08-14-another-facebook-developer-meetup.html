Seth Goldstein of <a href="http://socialmedia.com/" target="_blank">SocialMedia</a> (who I <em>think</em> are a competitors of <a href="http://www.slide.com" target="_blank">ours</a>) has organized a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=3400008082" target="_blank">Facebook Developers Meetup/Miniconference</a> of sorts this Wednesday from 12-5 p.m. at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=555+California+Street%2C+12th+Floor%2C+San+Francisco%2C+CA" target="_blank">Fenwick &amp; West</a> here in San Francisco, which I will be attending.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/1112309749/" title="Photo Sharing" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1196/1112309749_adb3667cca_o.jpg" height="150" alt="F8 Badge"  align="right" hspace="3" vspace="3"/></a> I'm not completely sure on what I'll be talking about, I'm thinking about discussing some of the issues with scaling on the Facebook platform, or the pitfalls of choosing <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/documentation.php?doc=fbml" target="_blank">FBML</a> vs. HTML for developing your Facebook application. There's going to be lots of market-speak I'm assuming ("OMFG VIRALITY!") so I'd like to bring a bit more of the technical side of developing applications that can explode on the Facebook platform.<br>
<br>
What I end up talking about is completely open to discussion, so if there's anything you'd like me to talk about, feel free to leave me a comment or drop me a mail at <strong>tyler [at] slide [diggitydot] com</strong>.<br/><br/><br>

While I am not one to discuss a lot about our "strategy" or "pixie dust" or however we've done what we've done, I do know how a lot of what we done works, and <a href="http://max.slide.com/" target="_blank">his Maxness</a> permitting, i'll be able to impart some of the &lt;fb:wisdom/&gt; I've accumulated upon my fellow application developers. If interest warrants it, I might start to share some of my sicker (read: <em>awesome</em>) FBML hacks on this blog, but since I'm a big nobody in the world of blogs, it might be a waste of time, so we'll see.<br>
<br>
Regardless, if you can make it this wednesday come on by and say "howdy"<br>
<br>
I promise I probably don't bite.<br>

Just in case you aren't familiar with Facebook's Platform, or what's exactly going on, I figured I'd cite why <a href="http://www.slide.com" target="_blank">Slide</a>, and in turn why <strong>I</strong> am (sort of) credible to talk on the subject. <br>
Slide has done a good job (in my absurdly biased opinion) on the Facebook Platform with some of the top applications such as:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 15px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2425101550&b&ref=pd" target="_blank">Top Friends*</a> - <strong>11.9M</strong></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2363570816&b&ref=pd" target="_blank">My Questions</a> - <strong>6.3M</strong></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2357179312&b&ref=pd" target="_blank">SuperPoke!</a> - <strong>5.2M</strong></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2355237624&b&ref=pd" target="_blank">Fortune Cookie*</a> - <strong>4.7M</strong></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2378983609&b&ref=pd" target="_blank">FunWall</a> - <strong>3.4M</strong></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2355822860&b&ref=pd" target="_blank">Favorite Peeps!</a> - <strong>2.0M</strong></li>(<small>Taken from the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/" target="_blank">applications directory</a></small>)<br/>(<small><strong>*</strong> applications I've worked on</small>)</ul></div><br>
