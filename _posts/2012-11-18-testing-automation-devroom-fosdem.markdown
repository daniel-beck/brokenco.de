For this next year's FOSDEM, I'm organizing the "Testing and Automation"
developer room. And wouldn't you know it, we've just opened up our [Call for
Participation](https://gist.github.com/4107243).

I'm quite excited about the dev room, and look forward to reviewing and
selecting the talks.

Hope to see you there :)
