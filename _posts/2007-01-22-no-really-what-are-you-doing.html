Like an idiot-moth to a bright lamp, I've somehow been sucked into the <a href="http://twitter.com">latest social web 2.0 zomgzomg craze</a>, I think it's just a subconscious geek's desire to be cool, but regardless, you can find my twitter stream at <a href="http://twitter.com/agentdero">twitter.com/agentdero</a>.<br>
<br>
Most of what's attracted me to the site has been their <strong>very</strong> simple API, which has allowed me to get an application called "Twitterer" up and running in less than a few hours (<a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/134/365711838_09664f372f_o.png" rel="lightbox">1</a>, <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/113/364696806_cbc6994d0f_o.png" rel="lightbox">2</a>, <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/364696788_eb29e53182_o.png" rel="lightbox">3</a>). I've not yet released it (no icon!) but i've been using it for the past two days and am quite pleased with it (if I may say so myself). In fact, if you have read this before, you might notice a recent trend in posts about webservices...ahem.<br>
<br>
Twitter allows the masses to finally answer the question "what are you doing?"<br>
<br>
To which the masses can reply in a most resounding fashion "nothin really."
