Rumor has it that there will be a <a href="<a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=5484699351" target="_blank">little meetup in Palo Alto tomorrow</a> to hack on some Facebook applications. The hackathon will be at Happy Donuts in Palo Alto, which is a hop skip and a jump away from the California Ave. Caltrain stop. I am planning on attending to hack on my <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/bugtracker" target="_blank">Bug Tracker</a> application (written in ASP.NET on <a href="http://www.mono-project.com" target="_blank">Mono</a>, which I will dissect and discuss later) as well as help out anybody that needs a good kick in the pants. Other than that however, it should be interesting how many folks show up and for what reasons, I'd like to discuss and share some of our sicker FBML hacks and maybe collectively play with (read: break) the <a href="http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Data_Store_API_documentation" target="_blank">Facebook Data Store API</a>. Should be fun, come down and hang out :)<br>
