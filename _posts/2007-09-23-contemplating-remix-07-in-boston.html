While catching up on about 2 weeks of Mono Subversion commit emails (about 1000), building Mono, and writing a new Facebook REST client library, I came across <a href="http://www.remix07boston.com/" target="_blank">ReMIX 07 in Boston</a>, which certainly looks interesting. I haven't been to Boston yet, and it'd be nice to at the very least, to try to buy Miguel and some of the Boston-based Mono team a beer, maybe to make up for some of my anger that sometimes blurts out into the IRC channel:<br>

<br>
<br/>The sessions on Silverlight by <a href="http://adamkinney.com/" target="_blank">Adam Kinney</a>, who I did <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/r_tyler_ballance/channel9_silverlight_interview" target="_blank">this interview</a> with, are definitely looking enticing, as I'm still trying to figure out if it's worth my time and effort, or if Microsoft is going to screw developers <strong>again</strong> (<A href="http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.13/13.06/ActiveXControlsforMac/index.html" target="_blank">ActiveX for Mac OS anybody?</a>). <br>
<br>
Most of the sessions seem to be targeting web developers, which is a role I find myself increasingly definable by, despite my role being clearly stated on my business card: <br>

Regardless, seeing what developers are doing off in la-la-Microsoft land should be interesting as most of my <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/topeight/" target="_blank">web</a> <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/fortunate" target="_blank">development</a> <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/bugtracker" target="_blank">work</a> is either in Python or ASP.NET(Mono).<br>
<br>
I am a little disappointed in the lack of sessions on IronPython and where that project is heading; it probably lost out to mega-mind-boggling sessions like "<em>Stop Building PowerPoint Backgrounds & Start Selling High-end Presentations</em>", which means I would have to settle on "<em>Just Glue It! Ruby and the DLR in Silverlight</em>" for my DLR fix.<br>
<br>
That said, will it be worth a trip across country and a couple of hundred dollars out of pocket? Any couches available in the Boston are? And of course, are Microsoft conferences <strong>that</strong> awesome?
