I feel like I'm slowly starting to blog like [@cansar](http://twitter.com/cansar) with just excerpts of other stuff that other people have said on the internet, so this is the last non-technical post for a little bit, promise.

**[This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/cpcv5/i_just_found_out_my_grampa_is_a_redditor_wtf_i/)** on reddit just about made my morning, well,  in addition to that delicious peach I ate.

The mere thought of my own grandfather on reddit or any other online community I frequent is a pretty big stretch, but to have him be a *notable member* of the community is unfathomable (not to mention,  run a part of it like [r/mayonnaise](http://www.reddit.com/r/mayonnaise/)).

I suggest you read the whole thread and enjoy a hearty belly laugh, only so long as you're not doing anything important like driving a bus or performing a colonoscopy.

**Updated:** As with most things, [too good to be true](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/cpl94/i_hate_to_do_this_but_our_beloved_grandapwiggly/). Although, I must say one of the most well done trolling performances I've seen yet. I remain unrepentant in my enjoying of a good belly laugh however
