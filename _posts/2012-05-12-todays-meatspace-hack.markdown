I always delight in finding clever little solutions to real world problems that
I have, the image below is a good example.

I walked inside from our front door and noticed that there was a bit of cool
air coming through the door frame. Unlike our last apartment, which simply had
piss-poor insulation, this door frame has proper insulation around the edges,
but the door was not pressing against it.

A little piece of cardboard moving box, combined with some slicing from my
leatherman, and tada! When the door is locked it will press against the frame,
keeping our place a little warmer at night.
