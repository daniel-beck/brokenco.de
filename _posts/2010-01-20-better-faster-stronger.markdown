I'm not going to cross-post but I wrote a little something on the [Apture Blog](http://blog.apture.com) about some of the things we've been doing lately to scale up with Django among other things. I suppose over the coming days I'll have to write a few posts here getting into the nitty-gritty about <a id="aptureLink_tKd7pOsk9o" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Spawning">Spawning</a> vs. <a id="aptureLink_4smreJAxpR" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache%20HTTP%20Server">Apache</a> and so on, but it's a good start.
