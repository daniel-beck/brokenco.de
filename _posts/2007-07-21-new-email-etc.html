Digging through my repository of domain names i rent, I finally found one I felt like using for some of my open source hacking; specifically my dealings with <a href="http://mono-project.com">Mono</a>, <a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org">OpenMoko</a> and <a href="http://www.macosforge.org/">Mac OS Forge</a>. I finally setup <a href="http://www.monkeypox.org/">monkeypox.org</a> for both email, general web servitude, and moved most (if not all) of my related mailing list subscriptions over to <a href="mailto:tyler[ZOMGAT]monkeypox[ROFLDOT]org">tyler(at)monkeypox.org</a>.<br>
<br>
You can find me at that mailing address for all things Mono, and most things non-work related. I'm fine with giving out a few email address @monkeypox.org to some of my Mono compadres, provided they're super-cool and pass a 42km long obstacle course.
