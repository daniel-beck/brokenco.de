I received a forwarded email which was passed around members of my extended
hillbilly family.

Just in case you weren't sure whether or not the US was filled with
**unadulterated fucking idiots**, behold this political action email.


All links from the email are "REDACTED" because these dicknozzles can go fuck
themselves.

> 
> *** *Force private and even religious schools* to teach a pro-homosexual
