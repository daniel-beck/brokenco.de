In addition to RSS feeds, one of my favorite sources of reading material is the <a id="aptureLink_kVnWAHwnNd" href="http://git-scm.org">Git mailing list</a>; I'm not really active, I simply enjoy reading the discussions around code and the best solutions for certain problems. If you read the list long enough, you'll start to appreciate the time and attention the Git core developers (<a id="aptureLink_xnlR489xfT" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/shawn-pearce/0/a93/61">spearce</a>, <a id="aptureLink_m0cWtPFy7a" href="http://peff.net/peff/">peff</a> and <a id="aptureLink_GNv5qRpV4O" href="http://gitster.livejournal.com">junio</a> (a.k.a. gitster)) put into cultivating the code and in cultivating new contributors. Of all the open source projects I watch to one extent or another, Git is very effective at bringing in new contributors and getting their contributions vetted for inclusion.

If you're a heavy Git user (like me) you can certainly see the results of their tireless efforts, Junio's (git.git's maintainer) in particular. I highly recommend checking out his Amazon [wishlist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/1513KNZE30W63) to thank him for his efforts.
