We have finally arrived at that most special day on the calendar, one I am
sure you have been eagerly waiting for: **Tyler Day!**. This year's Tyler Day
is not much different than in years past, it has fallen on a Tuesday. It always
seems to be a Tuesday. Festivities in the Northern Hemisphere are met, as per
usual, with the cold transition from autumn to winter. And to most in the
United States, Tyler Day is that last reminder to go to the grocery store to
prepare for Thanksgiving.

If you're looking for ways to celebrate Tyler Day, I recommend donating to one
of the following:

* [AIDS/LifeCycle](http://http://tofighthiv.org/goto/rtyler).
* [The American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclunc.org/donate/tribute-gifts)
* [The Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/join-eff-today)
* [The Camp Fire Evacuation Relief Fund](https://www.nvcf.org/fund/camp-fire-evacuation-relief-fund/)
* [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/sponsor/donate/)
* [The Free Software Foundation](https://my.fsf.org/donate)

For my part, I will be celebrating Tyler Day with the traditional Tyler Day
meal: too many servings of spaghetti followed by a pint of ice cream.

I hope you have a wonderful Tyler Day!
