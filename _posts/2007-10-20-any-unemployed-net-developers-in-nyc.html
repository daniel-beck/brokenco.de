Last week at the <a href="http://widgetsummit.com/" target="_blank">Widget Summit</a> speakers dinner I met an executive from <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/" target="_blank">DoubleClick</a>, you know, that gigantic ad company that <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2007/tc20070414_675511.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily" target="_blank">recently got acquired by Google, Inc.</a> While talking about some of the difficulties in developing scalable web products I brought up some of my history in terms of developing .NET web applications and of course, <a href="http://mono-project.com/" target="_blank">Mono</a> (at least I <em>think</em> that's how we got on the topic).<br>
<br>
As it turns out, DoubleClick is really pushing to modernize their internal infrastructure on the .NET platform and <strong>really</strong> needs some smart folks either willing to move to New York City, or that already live there. If you're looking, feel free to contact me at <strong>tyler@monkeypox.org</strong> and I'll put you in touch, or hit up their <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/careers/job_search.aspx">careers page</a>.<br>
<br>
If you go to work at DoubleClick, I <em>think</em> you can technically get away with saying you work for Google. You'll also be able to say you are working on truly scalable .NET, which is something I really only think Windows Live and Myspace<strong>*</strong> developers can say currently.<br>
<br>
Of course, if you're on the west-coast or lean more towards Python, <a href="http://www.slide.com/static/jobs">Slide is always hiring</a>. <br>
<br>

<strong>*</strong> <small>As it turns out, Myspace runs one of the largest .NET sites on the internet, and lays claim to the largest SQL Server installation on the entire planet.</small>
