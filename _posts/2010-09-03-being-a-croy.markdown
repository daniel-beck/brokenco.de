The name change that I mentioned in [my previous post](http://www.unethicalblogger.com/posts/2010/08/whats_name) is now official. This means I now have to update **everything**. I'm in for a world of hurt between the DMV, banks, brothels and strip-Parcheesi clubs. 

The only thing you need to do is update your address book, lucky you! I know at least one friend of mine has, who messaged me to say:

> *I put your old surname in the "Maiden Name" field in Address Book. Just thought you'd want to know.*


I spoke to my step-dad George on the phone immediately after the hearing was over and asked if there are "any perks to being a Croy?"


Still haven't gotten a response to that one yet.
