I recently found myself toying around with a number of web frameworks (like <a id="aptureLink_tRFJIRMTMP" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside%20%28software%29">Seaside)</a> to get a good read on who's doing what in the web world outside of <a id="aptureLink_ljYLBSCzVn" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python%20%28programming%20language%29">Python</a> and <a id="aptureLink_zIhQ3Jyxp8" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django%20%28web%20framework%29">Django</a>, when I stumbled across the ASP.NET MVC Add-in <a href="http://mjhutchinson.com/journal/2009/04/02/aspnet_mvc_monodevelop_addin_preview">for MonoDevelop</a>. Though the new Vim keybindings are <strong>sweet</strong>, I still can't effectively get work done in MonoDevelop yet. What MonoDevelop <em>does</em> do however is support generating Makefiles for any given project, which allowed me to create some Makefiles for an ASP.NET MVC project I had created in <a id="aptureLink_ZLtfq1CvMX" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monodevelop">MonoDevelop</a>, and port those Makefiles over to fit my NAnt and Vim-based workflow.<br>
<br>
Along with building the necessary DLLs, I prefer to use my NAnt scripts to fire up the <a id="aptureLink_KlgrO6UVvG" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUnit">NUnit</a> console and fire up a development instance of <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/ASP.NET#ASP.NET_hosting_with_XSP">XSP</a> to test my web applications out. All said and done this fairly basic script does the job; I typically run it with: <pre>nant test run</pre><br>
<br>
Not much else to say, hope you find it useful.<br>
