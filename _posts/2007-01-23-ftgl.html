I neglected to mention it here, but I <a href="http://stephen.paskaluk.com/blog/?p=37">released</a> some quick code to allow me to write text in OpenGL and C#.  It's called <a href="http://ftglsharp.paskaluk.com">FTGL#</a> and hopefully someone besides me will have a use for it.<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://trac.geekisp.com/bleep/wiki/FTGLSharp">wiki page</a> has svn info<br>
<br>
Disclaimer: I posted this in the mono category, but haven't actually tested it on mono yet.<br>
<br>
Update: I have finally gotten around to actually running this on Mono (version 1.2.2.1) on Windows.
