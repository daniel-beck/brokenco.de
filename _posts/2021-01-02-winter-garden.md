Of all the bizarre things to have happened in 2020, my winter garden may be one
of the more benign occurrences. I started gardening in seven or eight years ago
in Berkeley. The long backyard with excellent sunlight rewarded me with
incredible tomato harvests summer after summer. Autumn became the time when
everything would get thrashed or covered up to lie fallow through the wet
winter months in Northern California. After moving to Santa Rosa, my gardening
became much more serious but still packed it all in around October/November.
The last few winter seasons I have tried a winter garden with little success,
but **this year** the winter garden is **astounding**.

Santa Rosa is [hardiness zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardiness_zone)
10a and has a climate which allows for a substantial growing season; sometimes
I'm harvesting from April to October. The winters however are unpredictable.
This season we didn't get rain in October, or even really into November as we
might normally expect. When amounts of rain finally showed up in December, it
was a few days of soggy ground before the skies turned clear and the humidity
plummeted. Moisture aside, the frost and ground temperature are also
unpredictable. We have had days of 70-80 degree weather followed by nights at
or just under freezing temperatures. Despite some frigid nights, it's highly
unlikely that the ground will ever hard freeze in Santa Rosa.

Growing in these conditions is challenging, and in previous winters the snow peas
were the only thing that really succeeded.

## Status

It's January and I am astonished that the garden is still going, let alone
flourishing! The types of plants selected for the winter garden were all plants
that could handle mild frosts.

This year, around September if I recall, I planted:

* Curly kale, ~8ft
* Broccoli, ~10ft
* Cauliflower, ~8ft
* Yellow and red onions, ~18ft

Unlike previous winter garden attempts, all of the above were starts purchased
from a nursery. The autumn ground temperatures are too unpredictable to
germinate seeds effectively.

Fortunately, the temperatures and sunlight were strong enough in September to
get the starts really going before colder weather set in.

### Challenges

Aside from the weather, the big challenges that the garden has faced this
winter have all been somewhat predictable but I didn't anticipate them having
the effect on the plants the way they have.

For example, with big leafy greens you always have to worry about predation,
typically from bugs like moth caterpillars. Early in the autumn I feared that
deer were also munching away on the curly kale. By chance I was
admiring the garden through the window one early afternoon and saw a fat grey
squirrel sitting happily in the row, chewing away on my kale! Slamming open the
window I shouted at him as he scurried off across the street. I have since made
sure to throw sticks at any squirrels I see even so much as glancing at my
garden.

After the squirrel-incursions, the end of the fire season brought strong and
sustained winds to Santa Rosa. Fortunately none of the plants were too tall as to snap at
the time, but the cauliflower was still blown around quite dramatically. I
ended up staking numerous plants to ensure they continued to grow properly
after the winds subsided.


The last major challenge, which I should have known about but just forgot I
guess: **sunlight is different in winter**. Our garden runs east/west on the north
side of the house. In the northern hemisphere the sun dips lower to the
south during the winter. The result is only one bed sees strong direct sunlight
for more than a couple hours a day. I believe the lack of sunlight is
responsible for some of the inconsistencies I've seen in broccoli plant growth
during the fall and winter. Broccoli is the only thing which I've planted in a
full row, and the plants in the middle of the row look rather anemic when
compared to the ones at the end which receive good morning and evening sun
respectively.

For whatever reason however, none of these challenges have prevented a number of beautiful plants from growing, including the first successful broccoli harvest I have ever had!

If you have never had broccoli fresh from the garden, it will forever change
the way you perceive broccoli. There is notable bitterness in store-bought
broccoli when compared to fresh. I wouldn't call it "sweet" but it is a very
pleasant vegetable straight from the garden.

Kale is also _far_ better fresh, but then again what isn't.

Just recently a couple of heads of cauliflower have also started to show up,
which I haven't yet harvested. These will be interesting because the head must
be protected from sunlight in order to maintain it's good yellowish white color
and flavor.

The onions will certainly not be harvested until early spring, but the leaves
are almost all looking strong.

For a number of reasons, I cannot wait for spring!

## Dirty work

My "normal" winter routine is to work on the soil for the following planting
season. This includes aerating, dressing with straw mulch, and keeping moist.
This season is a little different since I have plants in the ground and very
little of the garden is lying fallow. Nonetheless, all the beds are dressed
with straw mulch. I have also been taking more of the fallen leaves from the
trees lining the sidewalk to incorporate more compostable matter into the beds
and walkways. Hopefully the earthworms I introduced into the soil have avoided
the birds and are happily eating away at the decomposing material in the beds.

When spring arrives, I will take another delivery of fresh compost and pile it on top
of whatever "green manure" is left on top of the beds, setting the stage for
the next growing season.

All the vegetables I grow in my garden can be considered organic. I only very
rarely have to use any form of (organic) pesticide, like that which I used last
season to curb powdery mildew on the zucchini. From a plant nutrition
standpoint, I do sparingly use an organic fertilizer for the hungrier plants,
but I have been using the same 25lb sack for almost a year now.

Neighbors have asked me how my garden does so well: **it's the soil**.

If I really think about it, the vegetables are secondary, what I'm really
growing here is dirt. Teeming with life, rich and productive dirt.

My hope is that by continuing to invest in this soil, it will continue to give me delicious vegetables _year round_.
