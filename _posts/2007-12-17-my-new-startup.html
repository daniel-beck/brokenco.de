I was talking to Dennis about quitting Palantir and coming to work for my startup which has no funding, and no time, but lots of brilliant ideas, when I realized I don't have a name for the startup yet. <br>
<br>
So effectively immediately my I'm naming my startup TY-Combinator and wouldn't you know it! We're currently accepting angel funding, demon funding, and picnic baskets filled with those little sandwiches cut into triangles.<br>
<br>
Also effectively immediately, I'm still going to work at <a href="http://slide.com">Slide</a>.
