I've neglected cross-posting some of the articles I've written over the past
month or so for the newly inaugurated [Lookout Hackers
blog](http://hackers.mylookout.com/). The generally idea of the Hackers blog is
to give Lookout Engineering a bit clearer of a voice and an avenue to publish
blog posts on things that are nitty-gritty and technical.

A couple of the posts I've written which may interest you are:


* [Integration Testing with Foreman](http://hackers.mylookout.com/2012/04/integration-testing-with-foreman)

    *At Lookout we find ourselves building more and more APIs and backend
    services these days. Naturally we would like to be certain that everything will
    work fine and dandy once it has been deployed. The reality of building out a
    service-oriented architecture is that you not only have to expect failure to
    happen, you have to plan and test for it.*

* [Continuous Deployment for Ruby Gems](http://hackers.mylookout.com/2012/05/continuous-deployment-for-gems)

    *With the above workflow and these conventions in place, we’ve reaped a
    couple of benefits, the most obvious one has been the severely reduced time it
    takes for new gems to be created and incorporated into production systems.
    At a higher level, we’ve gained more confidence in our gems with this emphasis
    on testing, traceability and code review baked into the process from the start.*

The blog is still fairly young, and we're getting more developers used to
writing blog posts for it. You can subscribe to the [atom feed
