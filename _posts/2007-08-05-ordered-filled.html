My <a href="http://bestpractical.com/rt/" target="_parent">RT</a> ticket #3824 was finally filled late last week, so I should be receiving my <a href="http://www.openmoko.org/" target="_parent">OpenMoko</a>-based (developer preview) mobile phone sometime in the next couple days.<br>
<br>
As far as getting <a href="http://www.mono-project.com" target="_;parent">Mono</a> functional on top of the device, it seems that the <a href="http://www.openembedded.org/" target="_parent">OpenEmbedded</a> project and their <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/bitbake/" target="_parent">BitBake</a> build tool. <br>
<br>
I'm wondering how easy the device will be to develop for in terms of getting Mono, IronPython, etc running on top of it, but if it really is the fully-featured Linux-based phone it's reported to be, this could turn out to be lots of fun (regardless of whether or not I can actually use it as a replacement for my miserable Cingular phone).
