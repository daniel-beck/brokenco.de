For the past two weeks I've been in super-mega-extreme stress mode, helping release an insane amount of features, applications, and fuzzy bunnies, which means my miscellaneous hacking time has been consumed by the man. I've got two week old code sitting in my /Software folder waiting to be tested, committed to Subversion and released for my "Windows Eye for the Cocoa Guy" series.<br>
<br>
I've casually mentioned to a few friends that we'll catch up when the insanity dies down, to which I get chuckles and "nice knowing you" comments. <br>
<br>
You Silicon Valley veterans suck. <br>
