Quite possibly my favorite part about working on open source infrastructure is
that I can **share** as much as I want! Contrary to corporate infrastructures,
where most of it is closed source and hidden away, open source project
infrastructure is by its very nature open. From a pedagogic standpoint, this
allows me to teach others without needing to create contrived demonstrations or
examples, but we can instead refer to the [real
code](https://github.com/jenkins-infra) being used to deploy the Jenkins
project.

On **October 25th** at **9am PST** I will be at Microsoft's Channel9 studios
with a [number of other smart
people](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/opendev/) to talk open source tools
and technologies with Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.

My session will begin at 9:45am, and will focus on **Continuous delivery of infra to Azure**:

> The Jenkins project hosts most of its infrastructure—a combination of
> Terraform, Kubernetes, and Puppet—in Azure. As an open source project, it
> automates the delivery of their own infrastructure-as-code, all of which is, of
> course, open source.
>
> In this session, Tyler will show some live examples of infrastructure
> continuous delivery with Jenkins and Azure.


Based on the previous Azure OpenDev events that I have seen, this should be a
lot of fun, I hope you're able to tune in!
