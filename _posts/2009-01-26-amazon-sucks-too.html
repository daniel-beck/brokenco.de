On the topic of online shopping "sucking", I have been sitting on this beautiful screenshot for a while. <br>
<br>
A couple of months ago I bought a watch on Amazon. Not a spectacular watch, a very basic Seiko analog watch that I had previously owned but had lost. I went on to Amazon to buy "my watch", and after finding it, I happily ordered the watch.<br>
<br>
Shortly after the watch arrived, I noticed a <strong>huge</strong> influx of quite topical SPAM.<br>

<br>
I'm pleased to say that I've not purchased <strong>anything</strong> from Amazon since I discovered that Amazon, or somebody that Amazon deals with sold my information to <em>everybody</em>.<br>
<br>
This still makes my blood boil. Rat bastards.
