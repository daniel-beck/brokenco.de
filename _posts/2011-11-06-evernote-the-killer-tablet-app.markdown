One weekend in the not-so-distant past I started playing with
[Evernote](http://www.evernote.com), reading all sorts of LifeHacker-esque
articles on how to use Evernote for super mega-awesome organization and
note-taking, etc. I was so convinced that I would **change everything** to
revolve around Evernote that weekend, that I went ahead and signed up for
Evernote Premium after only a few hours.

Then I left Evernote dormant for a couple of months, except for occasionally
clipping some URLs from Chrome into my "Bookmarks" notebook.

I honestly didn't take any notes, Evernote was a place for interesting tidbits of
information to die.


Then at one point, I bought an HP TouchPad, which I soon returned (after HP
killed the line) and picked up an [ASUS
Transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_Pad_Transformer).

I originally avoided Android 3.0 "Honeycomb" because, and I've now experienced
this first hand, Honeycomb _sucks_. That's not a point I want to dwell on, while [I've
started to keep track of some
gripes](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s75/sh/5226f888-240b-4dcd-8ce2-902578f8c6b4/0b9ee8e54c29f130117002c5254a7cf8),
at the end of the day, it's just not a very polished OS.


Fortunately, Android has one saving grace:

### Evernote.

The Evernote Android app is *nearly* perfect and combined with the tablet form
factor, it goes from "kind of useful" to "cannot live without." At the time of
this writing, I have over 300 notes in Evernote, with a rate of about 2-5 notes
per day.


#### Bookmarking and the Web Clipper

The tablet app combined with the [web
clipper](http://www.evernote.com/about/download/web_clipper.php) browser
extension has given me a cross between delicious and instapaper. Throughout the
day when I find interesting links, if I need them for referencing later I will
just clip the URL into my "Bookmarks" notebook.

If I find an interesting tutorial or article that I'd like to read later, I'll clip the full article into the relevant
Notebook. Later on the train, I'll go read through the articles that I've
clipped into Evernote on my tablet, which were synchronized to the device prior
to leaving the office . (*Relevant feature:* Offline Notebooks

#### Meeting Notes

I have never been one to bring my laptop into meetings, I don't particularly care
for it and I'm too tempted to get work done (zing!). Using Evernote on the
tablet allows me to focus on taking notes and if need be, occasionally jump
back to email or the browser on the device in order to double-check something
that might be pertinent to the meeting.

Sure I could take notes on paper, but having those notes immediately available
on other devices and copy/paste-able is pretty invaluable once you need to turn
your notes into tickets in JIRA or feedback on an interview candidate.

#### Product Design/Competitive Analysis

As an Evernote Premium user, I can share notebooks with other Evernote users in
a way that allows them to read and write to them. Using this functionality,
I've shared some notebooks with various colleagues as we scheme and plot.

Using a shared notebook lets us compile notes from our various meetings and
discussions on the subject, using Skitch for quick and dirty little diagrams.
On top of that, any relevant information we might find about potential
competitors, interesting APIs, etc, we can use the Web Clipper to clip straight
into that shared notebook.

#### Grocery List

Utilizing shared notebooks, I have a shared notebook between my wife and myself
where we add to-do items to our grocery lists, add other notes that we might
need to share between each other.

Being the domesticated house man that I am, I typically go grocery shopping,
tablet in hand with my grocery list full of to-do checkboxes sitting shot-gun
in the shopping cart. As I meander through the store, I check the boxes as I
pick up various foods. Upon completing my trip, I add a picture of the receipt
and the total price to the note. As time progresses, I not only have a clear
idea of how our grocery needs have been evolving, but I also have a good idea
of how much damn money we're spending on all our fancy foods. (*Relevant

### Missing Functionality

Unfortunately, Evernote isn't perfect and has a number of flaws which can take
you out of note-taking-nirvana pretty abrubtly.

* Shared notebooks have **no notifications** associated with it. The only way I know if you added something to a notebook is if you tell me, or I notice by chance. This *sucks*.
* [NixNote](http://nevernote.sf.net) is a half-decent client for Linux, but doesn't render rich text well at all and is a bit slow.
* The Evernote.com web application is decent, but lacks many keyboard shortcuts and can get slow when you're navigating a notebook with hundreds of notes.
* The web app doesn't allow you to create to-do lists as it does numbered lists, i.e. hit return and get a new checkbox list item, fortunately the Android app does this properly.
* If you have a spotty data connection, the synchronization from the Evernote Android application to Evernote.com will screw up constantly and your resulting note will be full of "Conflicting save : *timestamp*" which you will have to later clean up on a more full-featured client (like the .com).
* Evernote support is borderline useless. I've emailed them about a couple of the above issues, and I've consistently gotten back a templated reply, in one case, the support person clearly didn't even read my email before replying.

There's more good with Evernote than bad, I admire the approach they're taking
with the company and I'm pretty fond of their product (obviously).

If you're on the fence about buying a tablet of any variety, I recommend
purchasing a tablet coupled with an Evernote account, it's really the killer
app for tablet computing.
