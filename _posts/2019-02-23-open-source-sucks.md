I don't think anybody can understate the value free and open source software
has brought to the world at large, value which has largely been freely given
with little expectation in return. The ubiquity of free and open source
software seems to have fostered a sense of entitlement in the minds of some
users. This presumption that free and open source software should do exactly
what they expect it to do, and if not, that's a problem that _you_ the
maintainer should address. I find this viewpoint to be not only incorrect, but
abusive.

Today I stumbled into a ticket, wherein a user exclaimed, paraphrasing:

> _I love open source and I really like this tool, but the fact that this ticket
> is still open and not addressed makes it very hard for businesses to take
> open source software seriously._
>
> _This ticket isn't asking for anything crazy, a number of proprietary tools
> already support this kind of functionality._

I must commend my colleague who handled this ticket very well and avoided what
was my first gut reaction of "go fuck yourself." The tone of the comment is one
I frequently see from people who believe that they are entitled to something
from the free and open source community. What makes this one particularly
obnoxious to me is the passive aggressive tone, combined with the expectation
that others should do some work for free.

For me, much of my free and open source work falls into one of two buckets:

1. Passion-driven, I'm doing this for me. It's not that I don't care about
   people who might use it, but I don't care _that much_ about what those
   people might want.
1. Work-driven, I'm contributing to this project because it directly relates to
   my professional work. This is usually the case when I'm making one-off pull
   requests to some upstream project.

At no point will I ever do what some random person on the internet asks me to,
unless it fits into one of those two buckets. More generally speaking, if you
want something done in a free and open source project you should either
do it yourself, or pay somebody to implement what you want. Trying to shame
others into doing your bidding is _never_ appropriate.

We all have bills to pay,
