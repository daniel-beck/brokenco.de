I figured I might as well come out and say it, things have been changing quite rapidly lately, thus the latency on blog postings. In the past two weeks, I have accepted a job offer, moved to San Francisco, and started working at <a href="http://www.slide.com/">Slide, Inc.</a> with a friend of mine <a href="http://stuffonfire.com/">David Young</a> (and quite a few other folks who are prime friend-candidates).<br>
<br>
I'm not sure yet how this is going to affect my Mac (development) musings, but what I do know is that in the coming weeks <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and I are going to become best of friends...or I'm going to kill it.<br>
<br>
There's still quite a few things in the pipeline, such as an update to the Twitterbot, and Twitterer, a customized version of <a href="http://andymatuschak.org/pages/projects">Sparkle</a>, and of course, <a href="http://www.bleepsoft.com">Emission</a>. I hope that the dust settles soon so I can return to wasting endless amounts of time blogging and hacking on open source projects, but that remains to be seen.
