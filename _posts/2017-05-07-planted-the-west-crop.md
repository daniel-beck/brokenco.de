This season I have been expanding my gardening with more variety, which I
mentioned in [my last post](/2017/04/24/the-2017-growing-season.html), and now
with some _more space_. Thanks to a family member, who has generously granted me
use of part of her property, I have prepared and planted a 20x10 foot plot with
additional vegetables.

Contrary to all my previous garden plots, this was not going to be a raised
bed. Which meant the first order of business was investigating the soil.
Pulling up a spadeful revealed a **tremendous** number of worms, a good
clay/silt/sand ratio, and great water retention properties. The soil in west
Sonoma county seems to be fantastic by default, and this 200 sq. ft is no
exception. The only problem with the plot, was that it started out covered with
an invasive, crawling, species of weed.

I wanted to preserve as much of the sub-soil ecosystem as possible, meaning
roto-tilling was out of the question, as it upends the various layers of soil
biology. Another option I considered, if only I had the time and money, was to drive
metal or some other barrier around the plot (6" deep) and leave the plot
covered with black plastic mulch for an entire season.

Keen to get the plot started with as little disruption to the soil as possible,
Farmer Josh and I borrowed a tractor from Dan [the neighbor] to scoop and
scrape the crawling weed off the first couple inches of soil.

Frankly, I think I'm going to be battling this weed all season. I'm hoping that
I can keep it at bay by paying attention to the soil and hoeing proactively.
Farmer Josh and I also spread hay around the borders of the west crop to try to
reduce weed pressure by eliminating sunlight adjacent to the plot.

Each bed created is 34" wide and 20' long. With the alleys that's 10' wide in
total.
After scraping the weed back, the beds were aerated with a fork, hoed, and raked
to provide some loose top layers for the seeds to establish in.

### Plants

Since I have the north crop (tomatoes, snap peas, garlic, beans, leeks) and the
south crop (potatoes, pumpkin) already established, I wanted to use some of my
excess seed stores and plant some more variety in the west crop.

* More bush beans (trio). I had a seed packet with an abundance of beans still
  in it, so we planted over 40' of bush [green, yellow, purple] beans.
* Pill bugs (rolly polys) ate my zucchini starts in the south crop, so I also
  planted the remainder of my zucchini seeds.
* Unfortunately I didn't have the space for beets in the north crop this year,
  so there are hundreds of beets from two different varieties planted in the
  middle bed of the west crop.
* Finishing out the west crop, **all** the carrot seeds I had sitting around in
  my seed basket. 5-6 packets worth. In previous years carrots have frustrated
  me either by not germinating successfully, or by my own failure to thin
  effectively. Since we have the surplus space, trying 10' of densely planted
  carrots.

In the image above, going left-to-right and front-to-back we have:

* Zucchini, bush beans
* Detroit Red beets, Sweet Merlin roasting beets, bush beans
* Carrots, bush beans


### Tools missing

I don't currently have the budget or the storage to invest in some more tools
for garden farming, but below is a wish-list for later in the season, or next
season:

**Broadfork**: Aerating these rows with a broadfork would have been quick work,
but unfortunately I don't have one (yet). I have read quite a bit about their
use from various no-till farmers, and anxiously want to try one out.

**Stirrup hoe:** A good stirrup hoe would make quick work of some of the weed
pressures we have in this plot. Unfortunately I only have a traditional hoe
which wasn't really suited for the job.

**Seeding machine:** With larger plots, not that this one is "large", manual
seeding becomes a much bigger pain in the back. Preparing the soil for the
seeds and then dropping the seeds took me the better part of an hour. With a
proper seeder, it would have likely been less than 15 minutes.

Overall, the west crop is going to be a good experiment. I'm of the belief that
anybody can garden in a raised bed with pristine soil, assuming they have good
sun and water. Working a native soil presents a few more challenges which I
will have to contend with this season. Additionally, since the west crop isn't
on my property, I'll be making trips out there a few times a week, which will
require far more planning than the casual "step outside the front door and
get dirty."


While the north crop [is already producing](https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/34493649085/),
planting the west crop, assuming everything goes well, greatly expands the
fresh, organically grown vegetables the family will enjoy this season.

For now however, I have to impatiently wait for all those seeds to do what
seeds will, then the fun really starts.
