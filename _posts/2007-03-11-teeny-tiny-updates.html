If you look at the sidebar, you might notice a new "Twitter" column has been added, which I intend on using to keep a good aggregated feed of the unethical blogger users' <a href="http://twitter.com">twitters</a>. I have also added a new category "<a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/blog_categories/literature">Literature</a>" which I hope I'll be able to populate soon enough with book reviews, and other miscellaneous bits of criticism and commentary.<br>
<br>
I've noticed a few registered users that haven't commented or blogged about anything yet, which I hope they will remedy soon enough as I'd really like to sucker more folks into using the site or "blogging unethically" (har, har).
