This year I got tired of my strapped bike pedals and decided to get a
smidge more serious by purchasing clip-in pedals. Going into it, I knew that
there was a high risk of falling over at a stop light or any number of the
calamities other cyclists have experienced when their feet become attached to
the bike frame.

I visited my [local bike shop](https://www.bikepeddlersantarosa.com/) and
purchased some nice Chrome shoes, cleats, and asked them to install some basic
clip-in pedals on the giant bicycle I purchased years ago in San Francisco.
The young man helpfully installed the cleats, helped me tweak the tightness
of the clips, and gave me some tips before watching me roll off with the
trepidation of a new-born deer on my wobbly new legs.

Despite my best efforts, I could **not** clip into the pedals properly with any
level of consistency. My neighbors were treated to my slow heads-down practice
riding up and down the street trying to figure out why the heck my shoes were
not meeting the pedals. I could manage to force the pedals in and clip
properly, but it never happened on the first try, and it definitely was always
most difficult at a stop light.


Fast-forward a couple months.


My partner, who enjoys morning spin classes, finally buckled and purchased some
cycling shoes with cleats of her own. Being ever so helpful, I installed the
cleats for her the same way the young man had installed them into my own shoes.
The next morning she returned from spin class annoyed: she could not clip in, and the
instructor also wasn't sure what the problem may have been.

We returned to the shop with the assumption that the shoes had too much
moulding around the cleat preventing her from clipping in. Or perhaps the
cleats were simply pedal-specific SPD cleats, or perhaps she, like me, wasn't
yet trained in clipping her feet into the bike properly.

At the front desk we explained the problem to another fellow, who picked up the
shoes and took a look at the cleats.

"Oh, these are installed upside down."

"Some dummy must have not known what he was doing" I chuckled.

Returning home, I sheepishly flipped my own cleats back around. Much to my
surprise, clipping in is **far** easier when the cleats are properly installed.
