Just before I head to the bedroom for the night, I walk to the door by the car
port, fiddle with the lock, tug on the door handle. It's secured. Sliding door
to the porch? Secured. En route to the sounds of my wife's intermittent snores,
I check the front door, fiddle with the dead-bolt, tug the door handle:
secured. Great, _now_ I can go to bed.


I have become my step-dad.

When my wife and I started talking about buying a house, we used the place we
were renting in Berkeley as a blueprint. It was roughly three bedrooms, had a
wonderful backyard and was in what some have called "an up-and-coming
neighborhood." Which, by my observations, means it is in the process
of gentrifying. Browsing the prices in the San Francisco Bay Area however was an
exercise in humility. I thought I was well off, but without a surplus $150k
in my back pocket, buying the house we were *renting* was practically impossible.

When we had moved to Berkeley from San Francisco, fleeing sky-rocketing rent
costs, we evaluated Berkeley, Emeryville, El Cerrito and Richmond. For the
purposes of home-ownership, none would satisfy our wants within our means.

San Francisco appears to be the epicenter of absurd housing costs, from which
inflated costs radiate outward from the penninsula in nearly every
direction.

The half-life of this inflation decays the further from the penninsula you
drive. Looking north towards areas like Petaluma, Napa, Santa Rosa, and
Healdsburg showed promise in price and potential. Sonoma county in particular
became particularly interesting to us. Between numerous family events,
including our own wedding, we grew fond of the eclectic mix of rural farmlands
which run into hoity-toity wineries which reside adjacent to moderately dense
suburban towns.

After three months of painful searching, a stack of legal documents unlike
any I had seen and an eye-watering down payment: we had purchased our first
home in Santa Rosa.


### Playing House


The most exciting part about finally *owning* a house is: if you don't like it,
you can change it (you are of course financing any screw-ups or do-overs).

In the short 2-3 months since we moved in, we've already made substantial
changes, primarily with elbow grease, which I'm quite pleased with:


 * Bifurcated the single gas line/valve in the laundry room into [two separate
   lines and valves](https://flic.kr/p/rqZkFW) to accomodate the gas water heater and new gas dryer
 * Removed over 2 Ford truckloads of rock from the "backyard"
 * [Separated](https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/17006390398) roughly 20 5-gallon buckets of said rock from the remainder of the
   soil to lay the ["foundation" for a foot path](https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/17006402878)
 * Removed 5 cement fencepost foundations from the yard.
 * [Built 3 6'x3' garden boxes](https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/16681525110/), using reclaimed fence posts as the supports
 * Placed 1 cubic foot of mulch, and 1 cubic foot of soil for grass.
 * Installed 150 sq. ft. of drought resistent grass from a local vendor
 * [Planted blueberry bushes](https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/16860044786), sunflowers, tomatoes, cucumbers, basil, spinach,
   swiss chard and carrots in the garden

 * Cut down two trees
 * Dug a trench in the front yard to bury a plastic pipe to carry water from
   the gutter away from the house
 * Re-roofed the porch, shortening it to provide more sunlight by removing
   corrugated fiberglass panels and reusing the existing corrugated tin.
 * Repainted at least 1/3 of the house
 * Replaced 70's era toilets with new high-efficiency dual flush toilets


We also brought in some craftsmen to:

 * Install an entirely new outdoor electric panel replacing the two
   previous, daisy-chained together, panels manufactured by now defunct
   companies.
 * Removed incorrectly installed outdoor electrical outlets
 * Replaced lightly degraded (wood rot) flooring and laid new flooring in the
   bathrooms



We're not yet done sprucing up the place, but we've reached a milestone whereby
I'd gladly invite people over.



### Rooted


Most of the people in the bay area are renters, something at all uncommon
for the middle class here. It's a situation which allows many a great deal of
flexibility but for me renting was an uncomfortable condition of transience.
Having grown up in a military household, I have lived in 15-20 different
houses/apartments; always on the move.

Purchasing a home is not only a long-term committment financially, but
mentally. Stepping off the merry-go-round of leases, we are now rooted firmly
in the soil of Sonoma county and the city of Santa Rosa.

In years past I had given local politics a passing interest, always voting but
never engaging. Feeling like an "outsider", I didn't participate in community
events, or anything of the likes. Now residing up the street from a city
councilman, in a neighborhood of concerned and locally active neighbors, I have
the sense that it is only a matter of time before I more actively participate
in the shaping of *my* community.

I don't know what else our future in Sonoma county holds for us but so long as
we make the mortgage payments, and California has water, we're here for a
while.
