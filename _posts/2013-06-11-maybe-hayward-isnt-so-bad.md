I've had a good cadence of writing post-flight-lesson blog posts, so how about
another one!


The past few lessons, we've been doing pattern work, building one of the most
fundamental skill sets I'll have as a pilot: takeoffs, approaches, landings,
go-arounds, touch-and-go's and other near-airfield maneuvers. Previously we
worked in [the heat at
Livermore](/2013/06/01/wheels-down-livermore.html), and the [less sweltering,
but still warm Napa Co. Airport](/2013/06/08/good-morning-napa.html).


Today, time for the **big time**. Well not really, just
[Hayward](http://www.airnav.com/airport/KHWD) (KHWD), my home field. We worked *up* to
pattern work at Hayward because the pattern is **low**, 650ft on 28L, 850ft on
28R whereas most fields have pattern at 1000ft above the ground. Plainly put: Hayward is a
**fast** pattern.

The lesson was due to start at 8am this morning, but the weather forecast
wasn't looking promising: low clouds, the bain of the
[VFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_flight_rules) (Visual Flight Rules)
pilot. Our decision point was going to be the weather report
([METAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR)) for KHWD at 6:54am. In order to
meet VFR flight minimums the lowest the ceiling could be was 1200ft above the
ground. Checking the weather from bed is going to get a lot more common in my
future, either way METAR said overcast at 1900ft! Plenty of usable airspace, let's go
flying!

Due to the weather, not a lot of folks were going to be flying since they
probably would want to go higher than 1400ft (VFR requires staying 500ft below clouds
at KHWD), so the field was **empty** of VFR traffic. Only a few other planes
active, all flying
[IFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_flight_rules), and they were all
heading further out, I had the pattern to myself! Bonus!

After we get going, my instructor was showing me some useful ground references
for the pattern, then we did a few approaches and touch-and-go's. I was
exhibiting some of the same "nose-up attitude" problems I had in my [previous
lesson](/2013/06/08/good-morning-napa.html). By the 3rd or 4th touch-and-go,
I was working them out, and with the exception of some side-loading (sideways
momentum) squeeling the wheels on touch down, things were looking good.

Shortly after one take-off, my instructor calls the tower and requests a "short
approach". "What's a short approach?" I ask mid-turn, "you'll see" is the only
response I get. About mid-field on the downwind leg (opposite direction of
landing on the rectangle), he pulls the power back and says "your power is
gone, land on 28L."

Per emergency procedures, when you lose your engine you're going to go through
the following checklist:

 * **A** Establish best-glide **a**irspeed/attitude
 * **B** Find the **b**est field (runways, flat fields, golf courses, roads)
 * **C** RUn through your emergency **c**hecklists
 * **D** Declare your emergency over the radio
 * **E** Exit the aircraft, after you've landed of course

The best-glide component in a 172 is **amazingly** easy to accomplish, you
basically put in full nose-up [trim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trim_tab)
and the airplane more or less enters a best-glide attitude, giving you the
maximum distance over the ground for your altitude. Coincidentally, best-glide
airspeed is about 65 knots, and best airspeed for the landing flare is just
under 65 knots, fancy!

A "short approach" turns out to just be the first two steps of that emergency
checklist: best-glide, land, and you're done.

With my power gone, I had nothing to do with my right hand, and nothing to
focus on but the attitude of the plane. Having no power helped me
really focus on my attitude, and subsequently I had pretty darned good
landings without any power to futz with.

We landed and got back up in the air for another short approach, except this
time we got clearance for 28R. I was flying a 28L pattern, and received
clearance for 28L, and then my instructor pulled my power again. "Put it down
on 28R, you'll make that easy."

Another fairly good landing, still carried some side-load onto the tires (we'll
fix that next lesson) and we were done for the day.

Only at Hayward, with it's crazy low and fast pattern can you put in **11
circuits** and landings in a single hour of flight time.
