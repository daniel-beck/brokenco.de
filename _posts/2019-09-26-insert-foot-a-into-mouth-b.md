title: Tell your executives to sit down

Over the course of my professional career I have witnessed the transition from
free and open source software being something useful engineers do, to a
multi-billion dollar industry with companies [jumping into the
frenzy](https://kohsuke.org/2019/09/19/open-core-summit-event-report/). During
this time I have also gone from an open source user, to contributor, to a
[board member](https://jenkins.io/blog/2019/09/25/board-elections). Helping to
steward a few [small projects](http://jruby-gradle.org), but mainly focusing on
the [Jenkins project](https://jenkins.io/). Along the way I have interacted
with businesses in each role, forming opinions of their businesses. Getting a
sense of their cultural values by watching and listening as their employees
interact with the project, or their executives make public statements about
Jenkins or open source software in general.  By night I am open source
contributor, but by day I am now what enterprise sales people refer to as the
"buyer." One with opinions formed by years of interactions with these companies
whose products we evaluate.


I [mentioned
recently](https://twitter.com/agentdero/status/1174766277266558976) that
Datadog's early support for the Jenkins project has been a positive
long-term investment for the company. To expand on that statement a little:
exposing _me_, as a Jenkins contributor, to Datadog's product helped cement my opinion that
the product was well worth purchasing at **two** companies. It doesn't hurt that their
product is superb, and everybody I have ever met or interacted from the company
has been a delight. When those three things overlap, I find myself an eager
champion of the company regardless of where I'm working.


Sponsoring an open source project is not just good karma, it's good business.


I don't think of myself as holding grudges. In a professional setting it's
completely unwarranted. My previous experiences
with dozens companies through the Jenkins project and [Continuous Delivery
Foundation](https://cd.foundation/) has certainly biased the products and companies I
consider, but more importantly those I _won't_ consider. There are now
_multiple_ companies whose products I will either not adopt or try to deprecate
from use if possible.

I'm not going to produce a list of companies who are on a "naughty list" or
anything. In many cases the poor behavior from these companies is
[public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_(software)#History) and [well
documented](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/gitlabs-confusion). While some
behavior is less public and less well-documented, the overall pattern that I
frequently see is the public [throwing of
shade](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/shade) by executives,
marketing departments, and leaders at these companies.

Disparaging the work done by volunteers, disrespecting free and open source
communities, or attacking the [foundation upon which we build our
communities](https://opensource.org) may not
immediately affect the company's bottom line, but it will.

Negative marketing might get you some quick views but does long-term damage to
your company's reputation and trust, both of which are much harder to rebuild.

Give me reasons to buy your products and services. Don't give me, and the
others in open source ample justification to take our business elsewhere.
