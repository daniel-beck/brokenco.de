I was fortunate enough to [give a talk](/2011/12/20/speaking-at-fosdem.html) in
the "Configuration and Systems Management dev room" this year at
[FOSDEM](http://www.fosdem.org).

After some initial frustrations with LibreOffice Impress, I decided to take a
slightly unorthodox route in creating my presentation slides. Unfortunately
this route means that I do not have any accompanying notes to offer you
alongside the slide deck.

If a video becomes available, i'll make sure to post that, but as it stands
now, I'm not 100% what I said!

Here's a photo of one of my originals, which I had to bring with me just in
case. That's real printer paper with real felt-tip pen, yeah.

Giving the talk was a blast, the whole event was fantastic, I can't recommend it
enough. I look forward to coming back to Brussels next year for FOSDEM, and I
hope to see you there!
