As some of you (both rather) may have noticed, the <a href="http://bleepsoft.com/">bleepsoft.com</a> homepage is a bit different these days. <br>
<br>
In the very near future bleep will be releasing an application called "Emission" that, besides the cool icon, will certainly change how I work with the wide array of people across the globe that I deal with on a daily basis.<br>
<br>
As a lot of the network core is still unwritten (yes, it's very network-ey), so I'm not going to disclose too many details, but check out the site, <a href="http://www.devixdesign.com/wlog/">Fernando Lins</a> has done a fantastic job on the icon.
