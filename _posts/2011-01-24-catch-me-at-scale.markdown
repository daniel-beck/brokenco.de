Let's all pretend I have a Geeko-related pun for "SCALE." Anyhoo, [SCALE](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale9x/), otherwise known as the Southern California Linux Expo, is coming up in February (25th - 27th) and yours truly will be present and accounted for.

Yes, those are ***bus tickets*** you see there. I will be heading down from Oakland to Los Angeles by ***bus*** instead of flying for ideological reasons, so I'll *try* to be in a good mood when I arrive!

At this year's SCALE, the openSUSE project is making a [*big* splash](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale9x/exhibitors/opensuse). Contributors and ambassadors will be showing up from all over the globe to show off openSUSE, talk nerdy, socialize and eat tasty snacks supplied by Cruise Director, GNOME Accessibility contributor and openSUSE Board Member [Bryen Yunashko](http://twitter.com/BryenY), who just got his [annual haircut](http://twitter.com/omgsuse/status/26004394378010624) in preparation for the momentous occasion! ;)
