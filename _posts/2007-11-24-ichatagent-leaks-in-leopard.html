I really don't have much that I can say about this, I came into the office after leaving my Mac on (as per usual) for about 12 hours and found that I was out of space on my startup disk, out of <strong>all</strong> available system memory, and things were crashing left and right.<br>
<br>
What the fuck right?<br>
<br>
Well, after I recovered the system enough to pop open "Activity Monitor" I found the exact culprit.<br>
