If you're subscribed to my RSS feed you wouldn't have noticed, but if not you probably already know by now about the change in the look of <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com">unethicalblogger.com</a>. I got tired of the old (boring) red theme and dug around on <a href="http://drupal.org">drupal.org</a> until I found one I liked and then customized it to suit my needs.<br>
<br>
Other than that, I'm very proud to announce that this site is the 7th hit on Google for the query "unethical" (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=unethical&btnG=Google+Search">check it out</a>). Besides the obvious tactics (kicking puppies), I'm wondering how I can reach the #1 result for "unethical".<br>
<br>
Any ideas?
