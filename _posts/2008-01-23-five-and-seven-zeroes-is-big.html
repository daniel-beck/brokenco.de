It was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/18/slide-gets-their-huge-valuation-and-raises-50-million/" target="_blank">recently announced</a> that <a href="http://www.slide.com" target="_blank">Slide</a> (this little start-up that I work for) raised some more money. Neato.<br>
<br/><br>
Since <a href="http://max.slide.com" target="_blank">Max</a> isn't the <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/aeron/" target="_blank">aeron chair</a> kind of CEO, it looks like we're going to spend that money on things like "engineers, hardware, etc." Bummer, I've always wondered how an $800 chair can exist that doesn't rub your feet and write your code for you.<br>
<br>
Regardless, should be a fun year.<br>

(p.s. <a href="http://www.slide.com/static/jobs">we need more engineers</a>)
