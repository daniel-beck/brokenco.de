Today the organizers of [PuppetConf](http://puppetconf.com) released an
["almost complete"
list](http://puppetconf.com/uncategorized/an-almost-complete-list-of-puppetconf-speakers-and-topics/)
of speakers and talks for this year's PuppetConf in San Francisco, guess who's
on it?


Through some twist of fate, both of my proposed talks were accepted. Originally
I had submitted two sessions to improve the chances that I would be able to
speak on at least one of the many ideas I had swirling around in my head. I
didn't quite expect to have both talks accepted, but here we are.


I've included the titles and abstracts for both my talks below, be sure to
[register soon](http://puppetconf.com/register/) so you can also take one of
Puppet Labs' beta certification exams while you're in town.

**Red, green, re-provision: Test-driving Operations**

> The developers you work with have a new service they're building, and it is
> your job to add the appropriate Puppet modules to provision it. Where do you
> start? A base image, Vagrant and some tinkering? Editing files in "/etc/puppet"
> on a staging Puppet host? What is the most maintainable work-flow which won't
> saddle you with technical debt in the future?
> 
> In this talk, I will take you from the "outside" inward, writing tests along
> the way with Cucumber and RSpec. This approach encourages you to think more
> about where the lines are drawn between the various services and resources
> you're configuring. While the work-flow is a departure from the "traditional
> sysadmin" role, the resulting modules can be more easily re-used and
> re-factored.

**We'll do it live: Operations Anti-Patterns**

> I have done unspeakable things.
> 
> The best indicator of industry experience in Ops is an engineer with regrets.
> An engineer who has designed near-perfect systems but due to outside
> constraints has had to cut corners. Let's be honest with ourselves and air some
> dirty laundry.
> 
> In this talk, I'll take a jovial romp through some of the most heinous
> offenders of what could be considered "Ops Anti-Patterns." I'll share maddening
> stories from companies that I have worked at as well as stories from
> colleagues, who wish to remain nameless.
> 
> Names may be changed to protect the innocent, or guilty, or whatever.
