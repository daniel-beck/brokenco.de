Those who follow me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/agentdero/) may have
already seen this photo, but I wanted to share the story behind it.

Towards the end of yesterday, another in a long-line of terribly busy Fridays,
I was looking forward to heading home for a relaxing evening of **nothing**.
After all, we've only really been in our new apartment about a week and a half,
and haven't really been able to relax since the move.

On my way home, I swung by [Joergen's](http://twitter.com/jtjerno) in Oakland
to pick up the top tier of our wedding cake, which had lived in his freezer
while we moved. Lugging a box full of ice-packs and a frozen rock pretending to
be a cake is rather tiresome, making my exit from the [BART](http://bart.gov)
station all the more satisfying, the home stretch!

Walking down the street I see a policeman sitting in his car, idling in the
cross walk. "Assclown" I think to myself, the police can never just park in a
proper spot, they always have to be somewhere they shouldn't.

Brushing that off I continue walking and I notice red flashing lights a couple
blocks down, the progression of my thoughts are: "maybe there was a car
accident" and I walk a bit further. "I wonder if something caught fire" and I
walk a bit further, now estimating that the distance to the fire trucks is
roughly the distance I have to walk to get home. Then the worry sets
in.

I walk up the steps to the apartment as the trucks pull away, to an open
apartment door with yellow boot prints going in and out of the building. Erin
starts crying as I ask:


### What the hell happened?

Apparently, Erin gets home, changes out of her work clothes and texts me to
determine how long until I get home. Planning for my arrival, she turns on the
oven for the first time in our new apartment to cook a pizza to start our
relaxing night of watching shows and nothing else.

The oven starts smoking, she opens it and it's on fucking *fire*. She turns off
the oven and grabs the
fire extinguisher, sprays the fire putting it out. Walking upstrairs she
knocks on our landlord's door, after no immediate answer she walks downstairs
again and the oven is on fucking *fire* again.

The landlord's wife called the fire department, and neither Erin nor the
landlord could figure out why the fire refuses to go out, something *inside* the
oven was on fucking *fire*.

When the fire department arrives, judging from the aftermath in our apartment,
I can only assume they detonated a bomb with a few kilograms of yellow powder
in our apartment.

Yellow dust is **everywhere**.


The cat is scared silly and slept most of the night hiding in the closet.


The smoke detector works.
