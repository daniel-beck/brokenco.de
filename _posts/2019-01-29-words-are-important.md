The first bits I transmitted on the internet were sent through a modem on the
end of a old-fashioned copper telephone wire. While I didn't recognize the
complexity at the time, its ingenuity still impresses me. An analog-only
medium, the copper wire, could be made to transmit ideas via specially encoded
chirps, squeaks, and chimes, to nearly any other destination connected to the
web.  At their most basic, words are a truly astounding mechanism for encoding
and transmitting ideas from one brain to another.  Without language, the rest
of this wouldn't be possible.  Ideas alone are worthless, ideas *in transit*
are incredibly powerful.

Today I start something new. I am joining [Scribd](https://scribd.com),
an organization for whom the written word and its value, is central to the
business.

When I started my last job at [CloudBees](https://cloudbees.com), I joined as
an Evangelist and had to re-learn some of my lost appreciation for
spoken and written communication skills. As a result, I was re-introduced to
the power of descriptive, concise, and structured language.  Eventually
returning to the Engineering side of the house, with my newfound respect for
words, I was surprised to see just how poorly we communicate with one another.

From the outside looking in, it is incredible how adept many developers can be,
wielding numerous programming languages at once. Always finding the "most
suitable tool for the job" while consistently failing to utilize their most
obviously important language: written and spoken English.

Before computers, and I am right on a generational divide to where I can
remember "before computers," I consumed books, wrote stories, and was fortunate
to develop a rich inner mental space. That mental space later adapted, became a useful
backdrop for software development. It provided me with the necessary tools to
construct hypothetical designs, run them, and evaluate their performance.

Language is what weaves together our past, ideas from others, and new
observations, providing the necessary raw material for fresh and interesting
solutions to the problems we face.

I am excited to have the opportunity at Scribd to draw on much of my recent
years of experience along with that of my colleagues, to build a platform
engineering team, among the first fully remote in the company.  I'm looking
forward to helping everybody read words and learn _more_!
