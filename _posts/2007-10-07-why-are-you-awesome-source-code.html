I got off-stage just a few moments ago, but since Dave McClure already <a href="http://graphingsocial.com/2007/10/07/tyler_ari_awesome/" target="_blank">blogged about it</a>, I would go ahead and post the source code so Dave could link to it.<br>
<br>
<center><strong><a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/files/Whyareyouawesome.zip">"Why are you awesome?" source code</a></strong></center><br>
<br>
The version of the client that the code is using, is specifically for PHP4, you can just replace the client/ folder with the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/clientlibs/facebook-platform.tar.gz">PHP5 version</a> depending on your host settings. The source code also includes the database schema that "Why are you awesome?" expects. <br>
<br>
Happy hacking, and <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/whyareyouawesome/index.php" target="_blank">add the app!</a>
