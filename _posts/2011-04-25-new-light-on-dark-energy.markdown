Last night I was fortunate enough to squeeze into a packed house in the
Berkeley Repertory Theatre for a [panel titled "New Light on Dark
Energy"](http://today.lbl.gov/2011/04/11/science-at-the-theater-talk-sheds-%E2%80%98new-light-on-dark-energy%E2%80%99/).
Suffice to say, I was thrilled about the entire event, I didn't expect such a
massive line and a [**filled** 600 seat
theatre](http://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/5655954215/in/photostream).

After I managed to grab one of the last three or four open seats in the
audience for the two hour long series of presentations and Q&A session.

During the Q&A session I managed to get up to a microphone to ask a softball
question to the panelists: "*If we could give you an infinite supply of funds
and grad students, what would you focus on to identify 'Dark Energy' in your
life time?*" Panelist Greg Aldering had a fantastic response that ellicited a
number of laughs and sad-pplause from the audience (paraphrased) "The concept
of infinite resources is more mind boggling to us than any of the stuff we've
talked about tonight."


The night was a blast, if you're in the Bay Area I highly recommend you check
out the [Friends of the Berkeley Lab](http://www.lbl.gov/LBL-PID/fobl/)
newsletter and attend some of their seminars and panels in the future.


SCIENCE!
