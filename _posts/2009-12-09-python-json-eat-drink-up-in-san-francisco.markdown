A few weeks ago when I started working more on <a id="aptureLink_hhyMRd3A8o" href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=py-yajl">py-yajl</a> I discovered that there are actually a number of <a id="aptureLink_a5GTJ4H6TM" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python%20%28programming%20language%29">Python</a> developers who work(ed) with JSON parsers in the Bay Area. As luck would have it <a id="aptureLink_dBhA8T1qeq" href="http://twitter.com/lloydhilaiel">Lloyd</a>, the author of <a id="aptureLink_SbD3Rzx991" href="http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/">Yajl</a>, is going to be in town next weekend for <a id="aptureLink_WynkcrwDeo" href="http://twitter.com/AddonCon">Add-on-Con</a>, time to meet up and have some beers! I've invited the authors of: <a id="aptureLink_KNyBnc5k59" href="http://code.google.com/p/simplejson/">simplejson</a>, <a id="aptureLink_ZbikePoaB3" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsonlib">jsonlib</a>, <a id="aptureLink_iEdZR6OG34" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsonlib2/">jsonlib2</a> and a few other Python hackers in the Bay Area that I know of.

If you're in San Francisco this Saturday (Dec. 12th) and loves you some Python, don't hesitate to swing by <a id="aptureLink_TTUxypvCoS" href="http://twitter.com/21stAmendment">21st Amendment</a> around 1pm-ish to join us!
