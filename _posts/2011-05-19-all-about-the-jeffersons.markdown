I [recently
discovered](http://unethicalblogger.com/2011/05/15/learnings-week-19-2011.html)
that the branch manager at the Wells Fargo bank I frequent can order a
bound stack of two dollar bills on request. This is rather handy since banks
don't normally have *any* just "lying around."

Upon discovering this fact, I promptly requested a stack of 100 bills, or $200.
As I left the bank that fateful afternoon, giddy with excitement over my
**fresh** stack of uncirculated two dollar bills (I was rather lucky), I
decided to embark on a little project: **I want to see if I can
reintroduce two dollar bills into the local economy.**

The ground rules I've been following:

 * Only spend bills at local businesses, tips are a great way to get back into circulation as soon as possible
 * Record all serial numbers of bills whenever a withdrawal is made
 * Don't spend more than 4-5 bills at a time, don't want to run the risk of irritating whoever I'm paying too much


Thus far I've spent about $80 in twos between morning coffee and breakfast and
a couple of other beer-related expenses and the reactions have been
surprisingly boring. I had hypothesized that folks would have been a *little*
bit more surprised or taken-aback by the sight of 3-4 crisp, sequential, two
dollar bills.

I suppose outside of an election year, there's nothing that really surprises
most San Franciscans.

#### The bills

Since I've been recording the serial numbers on the bills, here's a quick break
down of the districts this money was printed for:

*Legend* **A**: Boston, **C**: Philadelphia, **E**: Richmond, **F**: Atlanta,
**G**: Chicago, **H**: St. Louis, **I**: Minneapolis and **L**: San Francisco.

* A: 1
* C: 2
* E: 1
* F: 10
* G: 1
* H: 2
* I: 14
* L: 169

I've not yet seen bills from New York (B), Cleveland (D), Kansas City (J) or Dallas (K).



I personally find both two dollar bills and the movement of money interesting,
EC (my wife) on the otherhand refuses to spend them.


Can't win them all.
