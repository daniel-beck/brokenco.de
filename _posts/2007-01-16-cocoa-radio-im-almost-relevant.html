Through some twist of fate, I was <a href="http://www.cocoaradio.com/2007/01/cocoaradio_mwsf_2.html">interviewed on Cocoa Radio</a>. I think I managed to maintain some semblance of competence throughout the interview until some random fellow sat really close to Blake and I and threw my concentration.<br>
<br>
It was pretty fun, Blake and I hung out most of the week (I even rescued him from the airport in <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/philaaronson/356041889/in/photostream/">blue lightning</a> on thursday) so doing the interview was a bit weird, as we talk regularly. <br>
<br>
And thus begins my long hard trek into the public consciousness; I'll be super-famous, just like Sting, you'll see.
