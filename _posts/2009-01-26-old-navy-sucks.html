I'm going to go ahead and admit something, something that's difficult for most men to admit in my situation. I shop at Old Navy. I'm sorry, I like their collared shirts. Sue me.<br>

This past weekend I decided to use an oldnavy.com gift card that I was given to buy some new jeans (as my favorite pair now has a hole in the knee). A "cute" side effect of redeeming an oldnavy.com gift card was that I needed to create an oldnavy.com account. "Cute".<br>
<br>
After I created my account, with a site-specific password (I generate throw-away passwords for sites that abuse the privilege of my business), I received the following email:<br>

Like I said, "cute". Damn idiots.
