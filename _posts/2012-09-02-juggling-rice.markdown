For the past couple weeks I've been learning how to juggle in my spare time
(and a bit at work). The act of juggling itself is surprisingly easy, so I
learned *how* to juggle in about 2 hours one afternoon, since then I've been
learning how to juggle **well**, which is much more difficult.

Thus far I don't know how to do anything other than the [standard 3-ball
cascade](http://kingscascade.com/3BallCascade.html), partly due to "poor
equipment" (partially due to "sucking at juggling").

The juggling balls that I purchased on Amazon turned out to be incredibly
light, which makes them much more difficult to catch properly. After lamenting
this fact on the `##juggling` IRC channel (on Freenode) I was linked to
[this guide](http://www.abc.net.au/science/surfingscientist/jugglingballs.htm)
to making your own juggling balls with rice and balloons.

Overall I think my wife and I spent about 30 making 5 balls out of probably 20
balloons, including screw-ups. The end result being the nice rice-filled balls
you see below.

I'm looking forward to the eventual disaster that's going to happen when the
cat rips one of these open, but until then, I've got some great, weighty
juggling balls to continue practicing with!
