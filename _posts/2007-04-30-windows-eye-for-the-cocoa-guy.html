I finally got around to posting the slides for my presentation at  the april <a href="http://cocoaheads.org/us/SiliconValleyCalifornia/">CocoaHeads Silicon Valley</a> meeting. <img src="http://unethicalblogger.com/files/keynote_icon.jpg" align="right"> The motivation for the talk was to introduce my fellow Mac developer colleagues to some of the goods and bads of modern Windows develolpment. One of the primary points I tried to bring across was that Apple doesn't <em>yet</em> have an IDE that I would put on the same level as Visual Studio 2005, which is arguably one of the most complex and complete IDEs out there (with Eclipse in a close second, in my opinion). Xcode (and friends) in Leopard are <strong>very</strong> close to taking the throne away from Microsoft in that respect, but there are still a few things that are holding them back, such as gdb, which is still a relatively primitive debugger.<br>
<br>
With .NET 3.0 however, Microsoft is fighting back hard for the make-believe "most cool framework" award, with additions like Windows Presentation Foundation (formerly called Avalon). The downside of a lot of .NET 3.0 however is Microsoft's incessant love of all things XML, as WPF is based primarily on XAML which is grotesque on a good day.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I can't repeat my entire presentation, and I didn't want to post my presenter notes, but hopefully you can ascertain enough information from my presentation.<br>
