Despite resisting the temptation to come on stage chanting "developers, developers, developers!" I think the entire <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=4184233826" target="_blank">Facebook Developer Garage - Palo Alto</a> was great success. Application developers from (in my opinion) well over half of the popular applications on Facebook and a lot of independent application developers showed up and in general good times were had by all.<br>

As far as my presentation went, I was apparently "<a href="http://coolastory.blogspot.com/2007/08/facebook-developers-garage-build-on-fb.html" target="_blank">a great speaker, spoke in depth about building apps thats scale</a>." But in general the feedback was very good, and I spent most of the rest of the day talking to individual developers about short-term and then longer term growth and how to attack that from a developer's perspective.<br>

Since I've updated the presentation, it's posted here again.<br>
