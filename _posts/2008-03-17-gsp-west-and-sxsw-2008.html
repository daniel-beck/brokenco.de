It's been almost a whole entire week since I left Austin, but it certainly seems better late than never. <br>
<br>
So far this month I've been fortunate enough to have been invited to speak at a few events, and one or two I just happened to wedge myself into anyways. <br>
<br>
I spoke at <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/gspwest2008/" target="_blank">Graphing Social Patterns West</a> in San Diego the first week in March on a concept I feel I didn't have the time to really explain sufficiently, <a href="http://tyler.geekisp.com/doc/Social%20Portability.pdf" target="_blank">"Social Portability" (pdf)</a>. Unfortunately most of the audience weren't developers, so I adjusted the presentation to shoot a bit higher level than usual.<br>
<br>
Following GSP I spoke at <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampAustinIII" target="_blank">BarCamp Austin 3</a> on building ASP.NET sites on top of the Mono stack <a href="http://tyler.geekisp.com/doc/ASP.NET%20on%20Mono.pdf" target="_blank">(pdf)</a>. The session was relatively small, so it broke down into much more of a round table discussion (we were sitting at a literal round table) about some of our experiences with ASP.NET on Mono through Apache2/mod_mono and Lighttpd/Mono-FastCGI, etc.<br>
<br>
Also while at SXSW I spoke at the Facebook Developer Garage Austin on the same concept as before, Social Portability, except this time the audience was <em>far</em> more developer oriented so I could dive into some nitty gritty bits of FBML/FBJS caveats, etc (<a href="http://tyler.geekisp.com/doc/Social%20Portability%20(Developer%20Garage).pdf" target="_blank">(pdf)</a>. The Developer Garage was especially fun because the Zuckerborg was in attendance, and I met more than my fair share of interesting developer-types that were either Texans themselves, or in Texas for the event.  <br>
<br>
March is barely half over and I'm already exhausted.<br>
