When I first started hacking on what I knew to be called "free and open source
software," I had never met another "hacker" in real life. It felt like a very
niche, almost insignificant community until my first
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) in 2006, where for the first time I saw *hundreds*
of free and open source hackers scurrying about. It may have been a niche
community existing primarily on IRC and mailing lists, but I finally had proof
that there were actual people involved in the endeavor.

Fast forward a decade, where software has taken a much larger role in the lives of
the average person, and every now and again I find myself surprised to see "the
stuff we make" in "the real world."

On my flight to this year's FOSDEM, I discovered that the in-flight wifi system
on the Boeing 787 utilizes [squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/) (3.4.6). The
in-flight mapping software makes use of
[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/). There was no doubt all manners
of Linux and other free and open source technologies wiggling around inside,
arguably, one of the most advanced commercial aircraft on the planet.

After disembarking, passing through customs in Amsterdam, I had the following
conversation with the customs officer:

> **Officer:** What are you going to Brussels for?
>
> *Me:* There's a big conference there.
>
> **Officer:** What is the conference about?
>
> *Me:* Uh, open source software.
>
> **Officer:** Huh.. Linux and shit?

I didn't have the time to clarify that technically Linux is *free software*
because of the GPL license under which it is distributed, and that the merits
of free versus open source software are a hotly debated topic, and also that
_technically_ the conference provides equal footing to both free and open
source projects. Instead I smiled, thanked the customs officer for his friendly
stamping of my passport, and continued on my way.

Free and open source software is now so pervasive and valuable to our modern
way of life, that it finds its way into the most interesting places, including
our culture.


Fancy that.
