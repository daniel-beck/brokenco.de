Last Saturday my instructor and I decided to head out to
[Livermore](http://www.airnav.com/airport/KLVK) for our work on approaches and
landings. With temperatures in the triple digits (38+ for the non-Americans)
around the Bay Area today, we decided to look for cooler air this weekend towards [Napa County's
Airport](http://www.airnav.com/airport/KAPC) (KAPC).


Napa was *cooler* than it would have been out at Livermore or elsewhere in the
Bay Area, but it still wasn't **cool**. Not that it would have mattered since,
like an idiot, I wore pants for some reason.

The [route from Hayward to Napa](http://skyvector.com/?ll=38.13398048292752,-122.32470703336598&chart=301&zoom=3&plan=A.K2.KHWD:A.K2.KAPC)
offered up another new experience: transitioning through Oakland's Class C
airspace. For the unfamilar, airspace around busy airports is typically class
A, B, or C. [San Francisco Internationl](http://www.airnav.com/airport/KSFO)
(KSFO) for example is class B, and there's not a high probability that I will
be flying through it any time soon. [Oakland
International](http://www.airnav.com/airport/KOAK) is under class C airspace,
which is less busy, but still requires clearance and additional radio work to
fly through it.

Before we left our parking spot, I was talking to Hayward Ground control and
requesting a transition to Napa. We taxi to 28R, perform run-up area checks,
everything looking good, taxi to the hold short line, and call Hayward Tower
with our request, tower responds "737 Golf Mike, hold short". Crap, now we're waiting for
somebody on approach to land; either way it's a good time to double-check some
things and notice that it's definitely heating up.

We finally get clearance for our departure, so I taxi onto the runway and then
we get going. I don't want to brag, but I'm getting pretty good at taking off.
Landing the [Ugly Duckling](http://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/8920019697/)
is another story though.

As we fly towards Lake Chabot, my headset is **killing** me, the volume is
totally wrong. My voice feedback is *far* louder than the controller, and I'm
having enough trouble to where my instructor takes some of the radio calls
while I figure out what the hell is going wrong with my headset.

Near the lake, my issues are sorted out, we're squawking the code they've given
us (our transponder is emitting the right code so they can identify us on their
scope), and we're heading up the 580.


As we approach Napa Co., we call and get clearance for 18L. Napa Co. has three
runways, and if you compare 18L to the others you might mistake it for a road
or a taxiway. It's narrower than the others, shorter than the others and
generally looks puny. In hindsight however it is the same width
as the runway I'm used to at Hayward (28R), and only 500ft shorter.

Either way, the relative "dinkiness" of 18L was definitely in my head. After
a rough landing, I'm told to clean up the plane for a touch-and-go by my
instructor. I start to feel overwhelmed, bringing the flaps up (we're going to
run off the end!), carb heat off (I'm not on the centerline! we're going to run
off the end!) and then finally he says "terminate, terminate, terminate." The
airplane was getting away from me, we go to idle power, and taxi off the end of
the runway.

He decided we would stick to 18R (a **big** runway) for the rest of our
approaches, one less thing for me to worry about for today.

Currently, my approaches are generally looking fine, my landings are
still too flat and I have had some amount of trouble keeping a constant nose-up
attitude when within 50 feet of the runway. Not that you care, but it's
important for me to know.

I clocked another 7 landings, 6 at KAPC (Napa Co.) and 1 at KHWD (Hayward) on
our flight back.


This might be one of the hardest parts of learning to fly because when it comes
down to it, I'm still the one mentally processing everything, feeling the speed
of the airplane, and planning the touchdown. My instructor can't directly help
with that, in his words "I can give you all the tools, but at the end of the
day, you sort of need to teach yourself how to land."


I'll be going back up, bright and early Tuesday morning, to teach myself how to
land.
